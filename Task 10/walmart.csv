Initially had a problem with the wireless connection, but turns out it was due to the Microsoft glitch that occurred in July. The printer is a little noisy when powering on, but once completed, prints quietly and quality is excellent. Scanner and copy functions work great. Have not tried the fax functionality, but am sure it's good as well.

All the perks and functions you need to act like a professional office model with a smaller footprint.  I did note a few cons, though, in comparison with to my 8600.  More plastic parts allowing 'slop' in critical positioning areas.  A less than precise paper tray positioning/ operation compared with my 8600!  A severely restricted opening to the print head/ ink cartridge access.  Not sure if this model will last as long as my 8600...10+ years!  The display area is smaller and less visible on this model than my 8600.  Also, it does not adjust up or down; you must look at it directly from the front!  The display menu is not as intuitive or as clear as the 8600.  You'll need glasses/ readers before you toss this model in favor of another.

This printer is about the same size so fits on my desk.  Price was reasonable.  It is noisier than the older unit.  Seems like grinding of gears as it starts printing.  It seems slower.

However, I am having difficulty with it. There are two problems. First, it periodically drops my Wi-Fi and I have to turn it on and off to get the thing connected. I have tried unplugging it. The bottom line is I have to turn it off and on, which is a nuisance. This was not a problem with Printer that was connected to my Wi-Fi before.  I almost never use the fax features. However, the other day, a friend asked me to receive a fax for him and it connected but would not handshake. I can send faxes, but I cannot receive them.

You cannot pull the tray out to hold the paper it's entire length when printed.  If you have a lot of pages to print the pages drop off over the edge.  2. It is so slow to print.  It takes 2-3 minutes after I hit print to get the printer to start printing and it drives me crazy! 3. A message comes on my computer every time I hit print that says ""your are out of paper.""  I am not out of paper.  The paper tray cannot be adjusted to hold the paper on all sides, so it slides in the tray.  I have to get up, open the tray, straighten the paper and shut the tray to get it to print. 4.  I constantly get a message that scan is not connected and active to the computer, when it is connected and does work.  Your took away features from the 8600 that worked and substituted features that do not work. 5. When I try to print pictures, because the tray does not hold the paper tight on all sides, the pictures print with uneven borders and crooked.

First, it gave me multiple notices that 3 of the ink cartridges were missing or damaged.  So, I powered everything off, went out to buy replacements, and when I turned it back on, everything was fine!  Then the set-up had problems finding the printer and communicating with it although it sits right next to the modem.  So, that took additional time to work through.  The printer also shakes more than expected during operation and many of the printer's plastic parts are very flimsy.  So, although I never had to contact Customer Service for help, I had many challenges to overcome during the set-up.

I do not believe I should pay dues on my own property, and if “ink dues” are not paid, even though you have ink, you cannot print. I may not go to my mailbox(mailhouse) for months, and the ink dries. I paid extra depending on the number of pages used, to cover “overage!” Buy your own ink. DO NOT ACCEPT FREE INK AND DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE INSTANT INK PROGRAM. I was in graduate school for Creative Writing, working on my thesis, extremely close to the due date.  My printer stopped printing, and I called HP support. I had to let reps into my computer to assess the problem.  They found nothing.  I finally asked if there was a problem with my bill. They didn't know and recommended that I call HP Customer Service.  There was a problem which required my providing new card information.  I wasn't notified prior to my printing was halted!  I started with $10 “dues” and ended paying about $15. The printer is wonderful, but after buying a printer, you should not have a monthly bill that bullies you into making monthly payments for what they want you to buy. I started Instank Ink with my HP 8025 Pro and just bought the HP9012e. I read an article about how well the HP CEO is doing and how profitable things are.  I understand!

I have changed my mind now because of this printer. I do feel the quality is still good. Unfortunately, the extent HP has gone to make sure the only ink cartridges that work in this machine are their overpriced cartridges is astounding. HP has now placed a chip in their cartridges. Maybe they've done this for a while but I haven't had the need to get a new printer until lately so I didn't know about this 'feature' until now. The chip basically ties the cartridge to the printer which means you can't refill, remanufacture, or otherwise recycle these types of cartridges. You can also join the HP Instant Ink program and they will happily provide you with a monthly subscription for your printer ink for a monthly fee. I never thought a company like HP would do something like this but I guess this is just the nature of the beast. HP is not happy enough that I am buying their product. They also have to strongarm me to purchase their printer ink for the rest of the printers life too.

The printer itself is not particularly fast and the sample pictures I printed with it are not the greatest quality either. All of them (B&W, monochrome, and color) were badly streaked. I suppose if you work in an office the speeds would probably be acceptable for a black and white picture but the color pics are very slow. Text is reasonably fast as long as it is black and white only.

Installing the printer software is horrible. Since the HP software for a PC is located on Microsoft's store, it also wanted to load their Edge browser on my laptop. Of course HP wants you to register on their website as well. All I know is that when I tried to add their software my computer stopped working (after restart it would not boot up) and I had several browser extensions that disappeared. I tried several things that did not work and after about 45 minutes or so I ended up restoring my computer to a date prior to my loading the HP software. That was the only thing that worked.

The control window on the front panel is too small: hard to see, tricky to manipulate scroll bars with your finger. The size of the control window has been the same for several generations of printers.  The second thing is I have a slight alignment issue: a very small white streak on my printed images.  OK ... I did the alignment when I first installed the printer; easy enough.  But there are still slight streaks on my images and it needs a second pass (which I hope will fix).  Problem is I can't find the alignment feature again: the navigation is confusing.  I will figure it out eventually, but I think it should be fall-off-the-log simple.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-02,MomFromBG,5,4-5-star,Great all in one printer.,"HP 9012. 
I am reviewing the HP Office Jet 9012. After unboxing the printer which arrived in great packaging , I read the easy instructions. I downloaded the hp app from iOS App Store. After that it pretty much installed itself. It connected wirelessly with my home network. Easiest install ever. 
It's a good size. All in one printer. Print, scan, copy, and fax. I needed to connect it with Bluetooth too. 
The printer can print up to 20 prints per minute. The color prints up to 16 prints per minute. 
The bottom tray holds a lot of paper, 250. The output tray can hold up to 60 sheets. 
After installed I registered it with hp. I had the option during setup to activate benefits. 
HP + requires an hp account which includes 6 months of free ink. And an extra year of hp warranty. Ongoing internet connection and the use of hp ink cartridges. 
There were 4 ink cartridges inside.I installed them easily. 
I really am impressed at how easy it was to setup. I didn't have to connect to router at all. I highly recommend the Office Jet 9012. The app in itself is amazing!

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-05,Faith,3,1-2-3-star,HP Printer,"Not sure why we can't buy a simple printer that isn't wireless anymore but this is a good printer all the same. Needed something that would print from laptop just about anywhere and this printer works for that. Just on a fair note it isn't a good idea to have more than one wireless printer in a certain area because of the fact that once you click print even if this printer is a default one, it will pick up on the others and print on them, I found that out the hard way. One good feature about the screen touch is that the icons are big and slide left to right where as some printers have tiny icons which make it hard to see for us older hard at seeing folks lol. Wasn't able to click a button on the printer to make it print had to either print from laptop and/or kept telling me to use app in order to print. Bad part about this printer is the ink, there are 4 ink cartridges for the printer, and to make matters worse trying to put ink in and the springs behind the ink spit them back out. Still a good printer though, just don't count of it being a small printer, a lot bigger than I thought.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=8,2024-10-26,US,,
,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-09,IMO,5,4-5-star,Excellent Printer for home office needs,"I didn't want a complicated printer and this is perfect. I can print, scan, copy and if I ever get a landline I can even fax. 
I got this printer for homework assignments for college and to print off invoices for my husbands business. It's big but not overwhelmingly so and it actually makes the space look more professional. At least compared to my last printer. 
Set up was easy and it prints very clear and it comes with one year warranty and 6 months of free ink apparently! 

Only complaint I have is it arrived in its own box wrapped in shrink wrap. If I hadn't been home anyone would have known what was on my doorstep. My name and address was just slapped right on the side, which I get was odd. I get not wanting to waste more packaging for something in a large box but maybe shrink wrap it in something colored so it wasn't so obvious, in case I hadn't been home! I posted a picture how it came, and I can update this later with a picture of it on my desk! :)",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=8,2024-10-26,US,,

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-05,jazzyjohn,5,4-5-star,"Secure printer, great ink and quality","The most important thing for a printer is security for me. The printer is usually the weakest link in any home or office if it is internet connected and doesn't get updates. It's easy to forget about the printer when you are constantly upgrading other devices. This printer has excellent security features and most important: it auto-updates it's own software.

In terms of the printer itself, the instant ink is a solid and long lasting option. I love the 2 side printing on this machine. The printing quality can go up to a pretty high level, I printed some high DPI / scale SVG graphics and it worked absolutely perfectly down to the dot. The quality is insane/the best I've seen in a printer.

As for the looks of the machine itself. The printer is sleek looking and it's easy to clean/keep dust free without any hard to reach areas that collect dust.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-06,JaminTunes,5,4-5-star,Awesome printer,"Mmmm, I just love that new printer smell. So glad I got this printer. HP fit so many features into this small package. The footprint is almost the same as my old HP envy 4500 but it is way better. Before I get into the specifics of the printer I want to mention the packaging because, how often is the packaging something to be impressed by, and I was impressed. The printer is boxed as you might expect but with one exception, it's bagged in plastic that has heavy duty handles built in. So unboxing the printer consists of grabbing the handles and lifting it out of the box. Take it out of the bag and your pretty much ready to go. 
The setup was just as easy. I did the entire setup with out referencing the manual. The paper draw is nicely tucked in so it won't break during shipping, but some genius at HP designed it to pop into place permanently with just a simple tug. Very cool. Turn it on and the hard part is over, really. To load the 3 color and one black print cartridges, just pop them in from the front and push firmly. Once it clicks it's in. Push again and the spring loaded catch releases and pops the cartridge back out. Push again till it clicks and it's in again. Since I didn't use the manual I tried this a couple of times before I realized how this worked because I wasn't expecting it to be this easy. Don't expect that dreaded wifi setup with this printer either. Just launch the HP Smart app and let it find the printer on it own. Since I selected the same network my phone was connected to, I didn't even need to type in the password. Load paper, calibrate the heads and start printing. That's it. So easy. 
The printer functions just as awesome. It's fast, reliable and smart. Pages just come flying out. I thought I was dreaming. As one of my first tests, I made a copy of my COVID card. Anyone who has tried to copy a small ID card knows you have to copy one side, and then flip it over to make a another copy on another page. Then for us ocd types who want both sides of the card on the same page, you need to position both pages in such a way that a third copy results in one page with front and bock on one side. Crazy I know, but with this printer just tell it you are making an ID card. Copy one side and without any paper coming out copy the other side. A few seconds later and out comes 1 page with front and back of your ID card nicely positioned on one side of the paper. 
What is like about the printer:
1. Speed
2. Quality
3. Smarts
4. Small footprint
5. A nice sized paper draw
6. Touch screen menu
What I don't like about the printer:
1. It makes some concerning noises like it's breaking inside. So far no problems so I assume it's normal, but it is concerning. 
2. Ink is expensive. Not sure how long each cartridge will last but, wow. HP offers an ink subscription but it's confusing to know which is the best option and they only give you a small window from date of purchase to sign up, so I decided to pass, because I felt like I was being pressured by a used car dealer. 
Overall I would recommend this printer any day all day. Just research the ink costs and see if it makes sense for you.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=13,2024-10-26,US,,

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-07,Hunt586,5,4-5-star,Great printer for mobile printing & hp instant ink,"After owning the printer for three days through 100 pages of usage doing paperwork for my company, I can safely say this works MUCH BETTER via mobile vs competitor products. 
I have a similar one of these in my office for my fax machine/printer, but I've placed this one out in the main area for usage to print paperwork on a as needed basis. We do a lot of printing for manuals and this is fast, prints without using a ton of ink on the fast draft format, and with seven months of free instant ink, it's a great buy! 
It prints a 50 page manual in about 1.45 minutes. Prints double sided without fail, and doesn't hang up.
My recommendation, using the HP Smart option to print, it doesn't error. Using the printer itself as the printing option with the PC, it will tend to have a bug in the software that inhibits printing, and errors out. I've switched by removing the software from my computer for the printer, and strictly use the HP Smart app to print. It works perfectly.
I also downloaded the app on the phone, and it's printed perfectly, both single and double sided. I like the features it provides for simple printing: (single/double sided, ink quality, and the features to print pictures, etc). 
I do like the hp instant ink feature, as I plan on using 300 sheets a month with it, but I may increase to the next size up in the future if we continue to work this one hard. The price is right, and cheaper than getting additional cartridges at retail. 
This one uses the 962/962XL Cartridges for reference.

The app also allows you to scan and fax very quickly, and the features to scan to the computer work within a second or two... Extremely fast and reliable using the App.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2023-07-01,jennifer,1,1-2-3-star,A Complete Disappointment: HP OfficeJet 9012e All-,"Where do I begin with this abysmal printer? The HP OfficeJet 9012e All-in-One Wireless Color Inkjet Printer is a perfect example of how a product can utterly fail in every aspect. It promises convenience and functionality but delivers nothing but frustration and disappointment.

First and foremost, the wireless feature of this printer is an absolute nightmare. Despite claiming to be ""wireless,"" it frequently loses connectivity and fails to connect to any device in the vicinity. I have wasted countless hours trying to troubleshoot and reconnect, resulting in missed deadlines and added stress-provoking situations.

The print quality is another major issue with this printer. Prints consistently come out blurry, with uneven colors and streaks across the page. The ink cartridges, despite being an integral component, are unreliable and tend to run out unnecessarily quickly. Replacing them is expensive and a hassle, making the supposed ""6 Months Free Instant Ink"" deal more of a clever marketing ploy than a true benefit.

Additionally, the printer itself is clunky and poorly designed. It excessively jams and frequently stops mid-print for no apparent reason. Its paper tray is frustratingly small, requiring constant refilling, making any large print job an exercise in patience.

Furthermore, the user interface and setup process are unnecessarily complicated. Instructions are convoluted and confusing, resulting in endless frustration for the consumer. Even the supposedly user-friendly touchscreen controls are unresponsive and sluggish.

As if the product's flaws weren't enough, the HP  service that comes with 6 months of free ink is far from satisfactory. Users are forced into a subscription-based model, pushing customers to buy HP ink cartridges over third-party alternatives. It feels like a monopolistic scheme to extract more money from customers rather than providing genuinely superior printing services.

In conclusion, the HP OfficeJet 9012e All-in-One Wireless Color Inkjet Printer is a complete failure. Its constant connectivity issues, poor print quality, expensive ink replacements, and frustrating user experience make it an absolute nightmare to deal with. I strongly advise potential buyers to steer clear, as this printer is simply not worth the headaches and disappointments it will inevitably bring.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=13,2024-10-26,US,,

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2021-04-01,consommateur,5,4-5-star,"Not just a printer, a complete printing package","The first impression of the printer is an attractive, commercial grade, quality machine. A quick start guide is included and HP offers instructional videos on their website. Initial setup is minimal, remove packaging, plug in, power on, install cartridges. Once the app is downloaded it takes over and sets up the wireless connection, HP+ account and instant ink in a few simple steps. *The printer can be setup by the mobile or PC app. In less than 5 minutes the Officejet 9012e printer was ready for service.

The printer fits perfect and looks great on the Winsome Wood Studio printer table I purchased for it at Walmart.com. The printer's power schedule feature eliminates the possibility of the machine operating at night when we're sleeping. Speaking of features, I Googled the user manual and there it was for viewing and free download, a whopping 214 pages of features! I can't go into detail, but I will tell you that this printer holds about 250 pages in the paper tray and about 60 pages in the output tray. It prints, scans and faxes auto-fed, 2 sided, multi-page jobs, controlled from the color touchscreen or smart app on any device. Excellent quality prints, fast! That's impressive. 

These days I don't print or scan a lot. But when I do, I have to go to the office supply store to do it, and it's a hassle. Then I find myself shopping for a printer but the ink cartridge prices always scare me off. I heard about HP instant ink before but assumed it was regular price ink cartridges, just delivered. After learning more about it, HP's instant ink service is a no brainer, and 6 months for free is included with this printer! HP has different instant ink plans including an entry level plan for someone like me who prints occasionally. Even if I don't print anything for a month it is worth the piece of mind. And, the unused rolls over anyways, if more is needed next month. We're only talking a dollar or two, that's less than it costs me each time to print or scan at the store, not including gas to get there and time loss. 

I am an HP customer since 1993, their quality products and support have been good to me. I currently have an HP Pavilion laptop dedicated at my bedroom entertainment center, an HP Touchsmart all-in-one PC at my piano, and a HP Ryzen 5 laptop that is the brain of my living room entertainment center and moonlights as my laptop to go. 

Now that the HP Officejet printer is linked to all three computers and my cell phone I have a complete HP home office, HP living room and bedroom entertainment centers, an HP music studio and a HP mobile app all capable of scanning and printing office, entertainment, and piano sheet music and on the go projects.

The touchscreen interface is intuitive and makes navigating through various functions a breeze. The wireless connectivity is reliable, and I love being able to print directly from my phone or PC. However, my girlfriend is unable to print from her phone from a different manufacturer than mine and she has to forward documents to me to print.

I don't normally set up the printer on my Mac computer. I usually let my husband. But I decided to try and set this one up myself, and it was so easy that I could do it. Plug it in, and it tells you on the screen of the printer what to do. The screen on the printer is a touchscreen. You follow those instructions all the way through. First of all you're going to turn the printer on second you're going to put the ink in  Third is going to tell you on the screen exactly what you need to do. You're going to open the tray underneath the printer to put your pack of paper. Then is going to set up your Wi-Fi for you. Very easy to set up the Wi-Fi. If you have another printer in your computer, you will need to delete these other  Printers. So this would be your main printer to print from. I can print from my tablet from my phone from my computer. My husband could print from his phone and tablet very easy. I would recommend this for any office. Use our home use. It prints really fast. It does use a lot of at one time . I also like that you can get three months supply of ink for free.

The standout feature of this printer for me is its impressive speed. Printing documents and photos is a breeze with this machine, making it a great choice for those who value efficiency.

Another aspect that I particularly appreciate is the vibrant colors that the HP OfficeJet Pro 9120e produces. The prints come out with rich and vivid colors, which is perfect for documents and photos alike.

Furthermore, the cost of the printer is quite reasonable considering the features it offers. It provides good value for money, especially for those who print frequently and require high-quality results.

However, one downside I noticed is the noise level of the printer. It can be a bit loud during operation, which might be a consideration for those who prefer quieter devices.

Overall, I would recommend the HP OfficeJet Pro 9120e Series to my family and friends. It's a fast, efficient printer that delivers excellent color quality at a reasonable price point.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-03-26,NHFReed03431,5,4-5-star,Completely satisfied with this printer,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For me, setting up the printer hardware was a breeze.  I unpacked my HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e according to the detailed instructions from the box.  I found these instructions to be helpful. The printer was contained in a plastic bag with handles to aid in removing the printer from the box. Initially, I used the Quick Start Guide. I was able to plug in the printer, select my primary language and location, load paper into the tray and insert the ink into the printer. A sample page printed out and I was able to successfully scan the page to align the printer.  In total, this took approximately twenty (20) minutes.  
Setting up the printer's software was as bit more challenging for me; however, persistence pays off.  I found it relatively easy to connect the printer to my WiFi.  I needed to research, and experimented some, in order to connect the printer to my computer.  With persistence, though, I was able to successfully connect the printer to all of my electronic devices.
This printer is wonderful!  I really appreciate the fact that it has the capability to print 2-sided pages which saves a lot of paper.

And let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

First off, speed. This printer is lightning-fast when it comes to color printing, copying, scanning, and faxing. I can breeze through my tasks without worrying about long waiting times, which is crucial for someone like me who juggles multiple projects simultaneously.

The quality of color prints is another standout feature. Whether I'm printing presentations, brochures, or flyers, the Pro quality color ensures that my documents look professional and polished every time. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference in how my work is perceived by clients and colleagues.

One of the best perks of this printer is the inclusion of 3 months of Instant Ink. It takes away the hassle of constantly monitoring ink levels and rushing to the store for replacements. Plus, with the 1-year extra HP warranty, I feel reassured that my investment is protected for the long haul.

The HP app with HP+ activation is another handy tool. It streamlines tasks and saves me time by allowing me to easily manage printing jobs from my mobile device or laptop. Whether I'm in the office or on the go, I can stay productive without being tethered to my desk.

Overall, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, quality, and convenience. It's a must-have for any professional looking to elevate their home office setup.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=21,2024-10-26,US,,

I've been particularly impressed with how well it handles photos - the colors are true to life, and the level of detail is remarkable.

Another aspect that I appreciate is the printer's speed and efficiency. It seems like no matter the size of the print job, the printer just powers through it easily. Plus, its wireless connectivity means I can print from anywhere in my home or office, which adds a level of convenience that I didn't realize I was missing until now.

The HP Officejet 9125e is very fast printer and cranks out printing jobs at a feverish pace. Despite the speed the printer also prints very accurately and produces smooth clean lines, vibrant colors, and dark blacks. The printer comes with 3 months of instant ink and given the printer has 4 different large ink cartridges it will definitely save you money on replacing its ink cartridges yourself. The only downside to this printer is that it is quite noisy when preparing itself and printing. If this is something that wouldn't bother you then I highly recommend this printer for your office/business printing needs!

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-03-12,geralde23,5,4-5-star,Game Changer!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a 32-year-old professional who relies heavily on a printer for my home office needs, I recently upgraded to the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e. And let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

First off, speed. This printer is lightning-fast when it comes to color printing, copying, scanning, and faxing. I can breeze through my tasks without worrying about long waiting times, which is crucial for someone like me who juggles multiple projects simultaneously.

The quality of color prints is another standout feature. Whether I'm printing presentations, brochures, or flyers, the Pro quality color ensures that my documents look professional and polished every time. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference in how my work is perceived by clients and colleagues.

One of the best perks of this printer is the inclusion of 3 months of Instant Ink. It takes away the hassle of constantly monitoring ink levels and rushing to the store for replacements. Plus, with the 1-year extra HP warranty, I feel reassured that my investment is protected for the long haul.

The HP app with HP+ activation is another handy tool. It streamlines tasks and saves me time by allowing me to easily manage printing jobs from my mobile device or laptop. Whether I'm in the office or on the go, I can stay productive without being tethered to my desk.

Overall, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, quality, and convenience. It's a must-have for any professional looking to elevate their home office setup.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=23,2024-10-26,US,,

I feel like I go through printers more often than shoes. This printer was a welcomed addition to my collection. Overall, it was easy and fairly frustration free to unbox and set up. Software installation took a little while and multiple tries, but once it was installed, it was ready to go! Overall, it is a good printer. It is quick, and has easy to use features. The scanning and copying are easy to use as well. The wireless functionality, leaves a bit to be desired, but I know that also depends on the wireless connection or the device sending the signal to the printer. Overall I am very pleased with it for a home office printer option, only negatives would be the software installation and it is a bit larger than I was hoping for.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=24,2024-10-26,US,,

I do homeschool so I print a lot besides other things I do. I like the paper tray it doesn't easily get paper jams . I don't like the fact that it has a chip on the ink. Ink is very expensive and I'd rather purchase my own and refill so this one feature I don't like but the printer itself and all its functions are wonderful from scanning to fax to printing wirelessly and also if you have the app you can print from anywhere .  So if you like the tracking of the app download it and they give you a free 3 months of ink though I don't feel this is worth it  through them .

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-04-23,GretchenT,5,4-5-star,This Printer is a Game Changer,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am an entrepreneur and I work primarily in my home office and onsite with my client-companies.  This printer is going to change everything for me!  My previous printer did color printing, but not well enough to use the documents with clients.  For client-documents, I have had to go to a printer. I print presentations and development reports that can get very long and are often set up to print double-sided.  With my old printer, I would have to do that process where you load the paper in to print one side, and then have to flip it over and refeed it into the printer the correct way to have the back print properly.  I do it incorrectly every time.  So, now I have great color, and a printer that prints on both sides of the pages.  Additionally, my old printer was so slow, I would press print and leave to go do something else as it slowly prints each page while making a screeching noise that increased in volume with each page.  So, I couldn't make phone calls with that going on.  This new HP printer is so quiet and fast.  It has more features and is actually smaller and sleeker than my previous one.  So, it is now out on my counter instead of in a hard-to-reach closet and is looks great.  In summary, less trips to the printer where the print job often was wrong and had to be fixed, better color so I can print what I need and go, and so so fast.  It is making me feel more professional and that I have control over the quality of documents I need to do my work.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=25,2024-10-26,US,,

The setup did require an app to be used complete the setup ( not sure if there was another way nor not). The app was actually a nice surprise, not only did it have the typical features to order ink, troubleshooting, ink status but it also had a ton of templates you could print too.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-03-12,daciresi,4,4-5-star,Solid printer,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The printer feels well built and is fairly large, though it still fits well on my credenza.  Set up was painless, using the QR code on my phone.  The first time paper fed through the tray, it pulled like 20 pages and jammed them up pretty good, but I cleared the jam, reloaded the paper tray, and haven't had that problem again since.  Printing from my phone is super simple and works great.  I must say this is a loud printer (at least compared to my last one).  The print quality and speed are both good, but there is a long spooling lag when sending print jobs from my desktop.  In fact, I've encountered several printer errors when printing directly from apps (Adobe, Word, etc.) & web pages from my computer.  It seems to work better when I send print jobs through the HP Smart app, but who wants to exit or minimize their document and open a separate app every time they need to print?  I may try deleting and reinstalling the printer from my desktop computer, as this may just be some quirk, but I haven't had the opportunity to try that yet.  Scanning works flawlessly, which is important in my line of work.  The jury is still out as to whether I can work out the kinks with my desktop computer, but so far I'm satisfied with this printer.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=26,2024-10-26,US,,

I love that it prints quickly, copies, and scans. It also comes with 3 months free instant ink.

I do homeschool so I print a lot besides other things I do. I like the paper tray it doesn't easily get paper jams . I don't like the fact that it has a chip on the ink. Ink is very expensive and I'd rather purchase my own and refill so this one feature I don't like but the printer itself and all its functions are wonderful from scanning to fax to printing wirelessly and also if you have the app you can print from anywhere .  So if you like the tracking of the app download it and they give you a free 3 months of ink though I don't feel this is worth it  through them .

Speed: this printer is reliable for fast printing with superior color and no streaks.

Noise: fairly basic sound when printing slightly more quiet than my previous but it is not a silent printer by any means.
Capabilities: love that it scans and faxs and is a smart printer, I have set up on my phone for it to print whatever I send it while I am out and about which is super convenient!

I love all of the features that this printer has. It is a copy/fax/scanner/printer and works from mobile devices. One thing I really love is that you can make double-sided copies, or even double to single-sided. I was concerned it was bigger than my old printer but it still fit nicely and the touch screen pops out and articulates making it easy to view if it sits lower. The Instant Ink is an incredible program as well, I was surprised how quickly my ink showed up.    My only complaint with this printer is how noisy it is. When it starts up and prepares to print, it makes very clunky sounds - almost sounding like it is breaking. I work in the office later in the evening so the loud noise is very unfortunate because otherwise it's amazing and I love the print quality.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=27,2024-10-26,US,,

I was able add and set up the printer with no issues on the HP app, I already had the app because of my previous HP printer. The set up was quick and painless. I like the speed of the printer and the 95% accuracy in scanning documents, it missed one document out of a 50 page scan. It's heavenly that this printer hold a nice amount of paper in the paper source, my old one did not.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-04-23,GretchenT,5,4-5-star,This Printer is a Game Changer,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am an entrepreneur and I work primarily in my home office and onsite with my client-companies.  This printer is going to change everything for me!  My previous printer did color printing, but not well enough to use the documents with clients.  For client-documents, I have had to go to a printer. I print presentations and development reports that can get very long and are often set up to print double-sided.  With my old printer, I would have to do that process where you load the paper in to print one side, and then have to flip it over and refeed it into the printer the correct way to have the back print properly.  I do it incorrectly every time.  So, now I have great color, and a printer that prints on both sides of the pages.  Additionally, my old printer was so slow, I would press print and leave to go do something else as it slowly prints each page while making a screeching noise that increased in volume with each page.  So, I couldn't make phone calls with that going on.  This new HP printer is so quiet and fast.  It has more features and is actually smaller and sleeker than my previous one.  So, it is now out on my counter instead of in a hard-to-reach closet and is looks great.  In summary, less trips to the printer where the print job often was wrong and had to be fixed, better color so I can print what I need and go, and so so fast.  It is making me feel more professional and that I have control over the quality of documents I need to do my work.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=28,2024-10-26,US,,

I have used HP products for years and always got a good product or service.   This printer is no exception.  
The setup was very easy on my smartphone.  I had a little bit of difficulty on my laptop, but I am pretty sure that was ""user"" related more than product.  Even with the hiccup setting up with my laptop I had the whole thing unboxed and installed and using it within half an hour, if that long.   I have printed, copied, and scanned several times and like it.  I have done everything wirelessly and have had no issues.  
The ID copy has been a wonderful option that I have used several times.  The screen and menu are user-friendly and easy to figure out.  
All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who does a lot of printing.  I am an at-home user, but I am also the family secretary, so I do most of the printing and copying for everyone",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=31,2024-10-26,US,,

All I can say is wow, the setup was easy and the print quality is great. We use this to manage 2 businesses and it has already started paying for itself.

I love that it is connected via WiFi, this reduces the cluster of cords in my office are and also allows me to connect other devices without having to worry if I have the correct cords. It's also great having a 250 sheet capacity feed tray, that in turn is months of paper at the ready without having the printer run out in mid print.

,Yes,,,Walmart,,2024-02-21,Mayhem1328,5,4-5-star,This HP is a workhorse.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this 9125e to replace my older 8620 that I've had for several years.  I should add it has never let me down, it was just time for something new.  This model has a smaller footprint which gives me a little more desk space. The main decision for this printer was the double sided printing and it does that with ease. I create and print work files from home and the ability to print on both sides without having to reinsert the paper is huge for me. And it surprisingly holds half a ream of paper!  I still haven't refilled the paper!  
I did subscribe to the instant ink program as I used it before - and trust me, it's a money saver. 
Connecting to the printer was easy - found my network right away with zero problems. Once you have it setup on your network you can print wirelessly with ease and straight from your phone. 
The print speed is pretty quick!  When I print something wirelessly - it's already printed by the time I walk to the office to get it. There is a slight pause when printing double sided, but this is to allow additional time for the ink to dry. It's literally just a few seconds and not a real interruption. 
Bottom line, if you're in the market for a very capable home office printer - this should be your choice.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=31,2024-10-26,US,,

This one has a nice and easy user experience even the little things such as removing the printer from the box. They thought ahead and supplied a plastic bag with handles to lift the machine out of the box easily. 

My favorite feature: the document scan feature is awesome. Lets you scan both sides of your ID and prints it on one page.

My dislikes: build quality is good but as it prints the machine shakes. Just make sure it's on a sturdy work surface and not something that can move. 

All around, this is a great home color printer.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/5152138188?page=32,2024-10-26,US,,

This is the worst printer I've had in a LOOONG time for 3 reasons. 1. It continuously and randomly stops communicating with my computer leading me to keep having to reinstall it. 2. I was taken aback when I first tried to set it up as you have to register an account in order to use any of the ""free"" printer and scanning apps  that come with this garbage. Unless you know how to set this printer up with drivers only, you'll be stuck with the HP big brother. The printer literally reports to HP every single page you print despite how you use it. 3. You'll ONLY be able to use HP-made inks for this printer if you want them to work and they will cost you around $40 per color. Generic inks just don't work.
