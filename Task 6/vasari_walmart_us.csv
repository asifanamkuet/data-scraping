HP ENVY 6052e,No,Vasari Base (Walmart),ENVY,Walmart,Epson - XP-4205,2024-04-06,ndmomma,5,4-5-star,It makes me happy.,"I have been a loyal HP customer for years. I didn't even consider another brand. I looked for what I wanted and what I needed. This fit me and my small businesss to a T. I love the chimes when the paper tray is open, after I print. It makes me happy.",,,,,0,hp.com,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,

HP ENVY 6052e,No,Vasari Base (Walmart),ENVY,Walmart,Epson - XP-4205,2024-06-21,Brett,5,4-5-star,nice compact printer. easy to use.,"Printer is great. This is the 2nd one I've purchased. Easy to set up and print to wirelessly. The delivery was very late with no update texts or emails, but they did call me the next day after I left a review for the delivery.  Seemed like he just wanted to dispute my facts on ordering time and that the delivery wasn't actually late, but that's ok lol. That's more than most companies would do, especially Ama$on.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,
HP ENVY 6052e,No,Vasari Base (Walmart),ENVY,Walmart,Epson - XP-4205,2023-09-01,Cifyoulikeit,4,4-5-star,Nice but,It was easy to unpack and connect to wifi and the print quality is goodâ€¦the but is there is no power off so it's constantly showing a bright light. So if you don't mind waisting energy and have an office vs a bedroom maybe you won't mind the bright light.,,,,,0,hp.com,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,
HP ENVY 6052e,No,Vasari Base (Walmart),ENVY,Walmart,Epson - XP-4205,2024-06-07,Walmart Customer,4,4-5-star,"Good printer, DIFFICULT install","I have run my on business for over 25 years. I did everything including the IT work. This printer does not automatically install the necessary driver to work. After 2 days of frustrating results, I called tech support. The agent I spoke to became agitated trying to find the correct driver and had to ask another agent. They discussed something called a ""Russian driver."" I'm not sure what that was about, but shortly after that discussion my printer was installed and working. I have had it for approx. 6 weeks now and have had no problems. I do turn the printer off at night due to a constant blue light. The only way to turn off the light is to turn off the printer. This causes an email about leaving the printer on, but after several days of turning the printer off the emails stopped.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,

Then suddenly, It keeps sending me texts that it is blocked! I don't see any paper jam. Ink is properly inserted, plugged in properly, and connected to wifi & internet.

One time it mentioned it needed paper but there was plenty, I thought. I added a little more and the message went away. BUT, it is still blocked. I can't use it until it is unblocked. I JUST BOUGHT THIS! Help??",,,,,0,hp.com,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,

True, it is doing the job of printing but scanning and copying have yet to be tested.  This printer relies heavily on ""light shows"" to tell the operator what's going on rather than messages that can be displayed either on the computer or on a screen, like the HP Envy 4510 series had.  Bottom line - not too impressed.",,,,,0,hp.com,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,

I just needed something basic. Color inks are nice. However, I found myself having to power off the printer constantly because it won't stay connected to my network or goes into some type of endless loop and I can't print unless I unplug the power cord and plug it back in to reset the printer. I have to do this about 2-3 times in an 8 hour work day. Very annoying. I contacted HP for help and was routed to a third party who was hard to understand and he wasn't able to resolve the issue.",,,,,0,,,,,https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/435156039?sort=submission-desc&filter=3&page=1,2024-09-20,US,,
