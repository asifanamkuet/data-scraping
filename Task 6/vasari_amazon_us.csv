My Canon died, and this one is dying after couple of years, printing a couple of times a month. It's always an abusive relationship with inkjet printers. At first it seems magic. This one with its  printing from my phone with the app that seemed to work well. Then it became kinda creepy with the app trying to sell me ink and keep track of how much I'm using it.

When I stopped using the subscription ink and the ink that I had from the subscription would not work because I was no longer subscribed, I realized that this printer was a gold digger. I admit that I was verbally abusive to the printer, but that was just a lashing out from my powerlessness to get the damned thing to work. Now after paying through the nose for occasional printer cartridges, the clunky app that is more marketing than function tells me that I should maybe change the printhead.

HP ENVY 6055e,No,Vasari Base,ENVY,Amazon,Canon Pixma TS6420a,2024-03-27,Ahmed,3,1-2-3-star,"Good Printer, Awful Support and Incorrect Information.","This printer is a good small office/home printer. It was easy to setup with the wifi. A mobile app is required to use different features and to tap into the configurations, such as knowing the current ink level. The print quality is pretty good. I have used the copy feature but not the fax feature yet. All wifi connected devices can access the printer wirelessly through wifi. You can even print remotely using the cloud-print freature.I would not get another HP printer unfortunately -- even though I know they are good printers, such as this one -- but here's why:1. We printed a maximum of 20 pages (including 2 pages that are printed out during installation to make sure the printer is aligned and the colors look OK). Then, we got a low-ink warning! The black ink cartridges seems to run out in unexpected fast rate, which means that the low price of the printer is going to be offset by this crazy pattern of reordering ink cartridges.2. Due to #1, I decided to subscribe to the HP Ink+.  I thought OK I will subscribe to the 50 pages per month plan (~$6 per month) and they automatically ship the required ink once it gets low (remember, the printer is connected to the wifi).So, the printer box and minimal manual page that is inside has clearly indicated that the HP Ink+ subscription includes a 3 month trial, which is free. Once I signed up using the mobile app, there's no indication what-so-ever regarding that offer. It shows that I'm enrolled and the ink will be shipped and nothing about the 3 month trial.I have been trying to reach out to support to see why I'm not getting the advertised 3 month free trial and it has been a nightmare. The 'virtual chat' feature is useless. It is based on crude AI that doesn't provide any help. The same for the actual support phone number. There's no way to get through a person to speak to, and when I explained the reason I'm calling I get unrelated options, such as: ""Do you want to order a laptop?"" or ""Do you need help with Windows security?"" !!It is a lot of headache and as I said it is quite unfortunate that for a printer of such good technical reviews, you get such an awful support and I didn't get my promised 3 month free trial of HP Ink+.",,Verified Purchase,,Model name: New,16,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08XYRVSRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=recent,2024-09-18,UK,,

So if you like to keep your printer powered up I would not recommend.  I also don’t like that the power button is in the back so I have to pull it out a little each time I need to turn it off and on.  Which is often. It also does not automatically power on when a print job is sent. My old one did and I wish I had thought to specifically check for that feature when buying.  I often need to print from other areas of my house and I need to go turn the printer on for it to print- since I can’t leave it powered on due to the humming.

For anyone trying to set up this HP Envy 6055e wireless printer at college or where a router is not accessible, I’m writing this review in hopes of saving you time and frustration (at least this is what worked for us). My daughter and I were trying to set up her new printer at college using the enclosed instructions. As directed, she unpacked the printer and plugged it in. She’ll be accessing the printer from her iPhone and MacBook, so she downloaded the HP Smart App on both devices. Using the Smart App on her phone, we received a message that setup should be completed on her laptop first. During this process and after repeated error messages saying the wi-fi password was incorrect (even though it was NOT), we decided to try another method. I learned from her university’s tech page that personal printers are allowed, but must be connected through a direct connection between her printer and her device(s). In other words, her printer cannot connect to the university wi-fi, but should communicate with her devices via “HP Wi-Fi Direct”. Realizing that we needed the printer’s Wi-Fi Direct Name and Password we had to figure out how to retrieve it, since printer setup had not been completed. We decided to re-start the setup process (if I remember correctly) – we powered off the printer and unplugged it for a minute, then plugged it back in and turned it on. We loaded a small amount of paper and inserted the ink cartridges. I’m unable to post the external link, but we searched HP support for HP Envy 6055e Wi-Fi Direct setup. Using the step-by-step instructions, we were able to use the “Information” button on the printer to print out the necessary Wi-Fi Direct Name and Password, TURN ON Wi-Fi Direct and proceed with setup.After several frustrating hours my daughter was finally able to complete setup on both devices and print successfully. The most important thing to note – whether printing from a phone or laptop –  “if you want to print web content, such as an email or cloud-based document, open the item before proceeding.” To sum up, use your regular wi-fi connection to open your document, then use your device’s wi-fi network menu to select your printer (starting with DIRECT and your printer model) and proceed to print.The process sounds complicated, but is fairly straightforward when following the HP Wi-Fi Direct Setup.Although we had hoped the printer would be more user-friendly, we were ultimately satisfied to find a way for her to use it on campus.FYI - During setup we chose NOT to enroll in HP+ or HP Instant InkGood Luck!",,Verified Purchase,,Model name: New,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08XYRVSRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=recent,2024-09-18,UK,,

My office printer is an HP to which I already have the ink subscription as I do print a lot of pages between my real job and my online jewelry shop.Setting up this printer with a wi-fi coming thru a wi-fi extender can be a bit of a challenge BUT it can still work. My office HP was easy to set up because it's in the same place the main modem/router is. How far the printer has to access the wi-fi is one thing to consider when installing.Once the printer is plugged up a ""test page"" is printed, then there will be additional print outs that will have all information you will need (i.e. Printer Model , password , etc. ). You MIGHT need this as you set it up. When setting up the driver, the printer will also pick up on this and will print out whatever ""code"" you'll be needing to complete the set up.I find that this printer goes ""offline"" more often than not and takes a bit to ""wake up"" from its sleep mode. AGAIN, this maybe due to the fact that the wi-fi is coming thru an extender. Therefore, in instances like this, the printer needs to be powered on & off then the wi-fi icon on the printer has to light up to establish connectivity THEN I can finally print... that'll take like 2 to 3 minutes which is too long when attempting to complete an order that's ready to go.To fix that, I went ahead and purchased a printer cable so I'm hoping this will speed things up.Print quality is good + printing speed is good. Overall it's ""ok"" if you want a simple printer for simple tasks.*I've read other reviews that their printer will not print if HP identifies that the cartridges used to replace for ink are not valid ""HP Ink cartridges"". My work does provide for my ink cartridges (as I do work from home at times) ordered thru Staples. These are still HP cartridges. When I do pop these in (the ones I got from Staples), I will get a ""pop up"" box from HP stating that the cartridges may not be HP ink cartridgesBUT the printer still DOES allow me to continue printing. I'll get those pop ups about 2 to 3 more times then it goes away.  By then, I'll receive the replacement cartridges that HP does send me & I just save them for the next time.",,Verified Purchase,,Model name: New,27,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08XYRVSRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=recent,2024-09-18,UK,,
