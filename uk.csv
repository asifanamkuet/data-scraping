This is probably the worst printer I have ever used. It is not intuitive at all. The instructions are not helpful and the feature that assists duplex printing is a waste of paper.

I have finally requested the hard copy to be sent to my by post, something I have not done for about twenty years. As you pay for the ink subscription by the number of sheets you print, I used up more than my allowance.

I've gone through support, I've followed all the recommended or available cleaning and re-aligning procedures and still it looks like crap.Also, if you do choose to cancel Instant Ink, You cant use the ink cartridges since they require an active subscription to use them.

HP DeskJet 2810e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-07-25,Pedro,1,The worst printer you can have,"Stay far, far away from the HP 2800 Series if you value your time and sanity. This printer is nothing short of a disaster, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.Setting up this monstrosity is an exercise in futility. I spent countless hours trying to get it to work, following every instruction to the letter, but to no avail. Even with the help of an IT engineer, we couldn't get this thing to function properly. It's as if HP designed it to be deliberately incomprehensible.The user interface is about as intuitive as ancient hieroglyphics. Connectivity issues plague this printer like a curse, refusing to stay connected to Wi-Fi or computers for more than a few minutes at a time. When you finally think you've got it working, it decides to throw a tantrum and forget all your settings.Print quality? Let's just say a child with crayons could produce better results. Paper jams are more frequent than actual printing, and the ink seems to evaporate faster than water in the Sahara.Customer support is a joke. You'll spend hours on hold, only to be told to do the same useless troubleshooting steps you've already tried a hundred times.In conclusion, if you enjoy headaches, wasted time, and the feeling of utter despair, by all means, purchase the HP 2800 Series. For everyone else, I strongly advise looking elsewhere for your printing needs. This product should come with a warning label: ""Guaranteed to make you question your life choices.""Do yourself a favor and pretend the HP 2800 Series doesn't exist.

One was borderless printing, which is literally non-existent. It DOES NOT do borderless printing, and even cuts off the page all my current docunent designs.The second reason I got it, was for the double sided printing. I'm really shocked by this!!!!! There version of what they think double sided printing is you priting one side, then MANUALLY having to re-inrsert it back into the paper tray (which as a reminder is very difficult to get paper of any amount to fit in. I had to take the whole lot out, just to put one the printed paper back in - and then you have to click continue on your laptop). I'd find the whole process easier just printing several copies of one side, and then re-insert them all and print them all together on the other side separate.This is BY FAR the WORST printer I have ever owned, and is the biggest piece of junk ever.

Corporate greed and control at is worst ( although HP do make the need to buy only HP genuine ink very clear, more fool me for buying into it I suppose).The canon replacement works every single time, it's fast, has automatic duplex printing, a front cassette as well as rear paper input. So many more print , scan copy options available on the easy to use large colour screen and from the app, and was simple to set up. I also don't have to convert everything to pdf in order for it to print. (a painfully slow experience from the HP app).

Eventually managed to pick our way through the confusing and unhelpful instructions on-screen.  Once that was done, still awkward to get it to print and have to go through a final screen to print which was unnecessary.  However, the printer kept cutting out and going off.  Discovered this yesterday - the power lead is very loose connecting to the printer body and kept falling out or too loose for power.  The printer itself is elegant, a nice white colour, the printing is quicker than Canon (don't ever be tempted to buy a Canon) and above all very quiet.  The only problem is that the paper catcher is inadequate and there is a piece of plastic sticking out the base at the front which serves no purpose.  The power on light is also white which is a bit hard to see.  The problem with the power lead was reported to Amazon and they are replacing the machine the next day.

This printer it just gives you a few default sizes. There is an app you can use which gives you a few extra sizes like photo sizes but again these are default. There is a pain staking way of pasting a photo or document onto a page and then dragging the corners to change its size but it’s very long winded and fiddly. The other issue is getting the damn thing to actually print sometimes. You press print and nothing happens.

Setting it up was a relatively simple process and the Wi-Fi connection has been reliable so far. The print quality is pretty decent, especially for text documents and printing sewing patterns. I was also happy with the included 3 months of Instant Ink, which helped me avoid running out of ink right away (it's also super easy to set up your subscription and once the free months run out the subscription options aren't too expensive either).However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The printing speed isn't the fastest, so it's not ideal for high-volume printing jobs. This is especially true when printing pictures, even really basic ones and even when you're printing one image. My mother still has her old dot matrix printer from the mid 1980s and while it doesn't print in colour the black and white images it produces still print faster than this HP printer doing the same job!Also the paper tray is a bit on the small side, so you'll need to refill it more often if you print a lot. I think this holds 60 pages.Overall, I'd give the HP DeskJet 2810e 4 out of 5 stars. It's a good value for the (sale) price, and it's easy to use. Just be aware of the limitations if you need a printer for heavy-duty tasks and pictures. I bought this when it was in a sale and paid under £40 which is about right.

I don't have complicated printing requirements and have an IT background so I'm happy with it for the money, I don't think it's plug and play though - if you aren't really confident with tech set up you might struggle. Can't be bothered to spend too long faffing with it tbh to see if it can do other formats. Subscription ink seems ok so far.

The item was delivered the following day and was well-packaged. The instructions directed me to download and install the HP app on my smartphone to complete the setup. The app and the on-screen instructions were very easy to follow, however, this may be more difficult for someone who is not tech-minded. The printer itself is very slick and modern-looking and feels solid. It came with a set of inks that were also very easy to install.
