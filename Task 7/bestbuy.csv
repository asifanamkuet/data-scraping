HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-09,Viabledata,5,4-5-star,A great basic all in one setup,"The HP deskjet is a fast, efficient, and quality printer that is great for your basic needs. Its direct connection or wireless wifi connection give you options to connect however you need. 

Out of the box, the printer is pretty easy to set up. You will only need a tiny plot of real-estate to set the printer up in, as this printer is very minimalistic in its features. It comes with a color and black cartridge, and the power cord. It does not come with the usb 2.0 plug if you wish to connect it wired to your pc. You will need to download the hp smart app on phone or tablet  to setup the printer and you can also visit the hp website to download the drivers for pc install. Printer will need to be set up on same wifi network as all devices wishing to print. 

The left strip on top of the printer serves as the control panel. It is a bit difficult to remember the functions of each button, and the lcd displays basic icons. I needed to referr to the manual several times to remember everything. 

Printing is at a pretty quick speed for this type of printer and the overall quality of the print is  pretty good as well. With a ribbon cartridge type printer, it can go through ink pretty quickly depending on the type of print and amount of blacks or colors in your print.  Cartridges can be expensive, but HP does offer 3 months of free ink with their Instant-Ink program that will auto ship new cartriges when you start running low. 

The flatbed scanner is a nice design and easy to use. It is a little slow on the scans, but does produce a great quality file to use. 

Overall, I think it is a great basic printer and scanner. I wish the power cord was another foot longer, but I do enjoy the smaller design and basic control panel. It prints great and gets the job done. Its wireless connectivity gives many printing options. I think it is time to phase away from cartridge printers but for what this is, it's a good setup.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=6,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-05,DarR,4,4-5-star,Decent Home Printer,"This Deskjet 2855e is a compact capable printer for light home printing needs.

Setup
Setting up the hardware was fairly easy. The printer is nicely wrapped in plastic so I was not afraid of breaking anything as I pulled it out of the box. Other components are taped onto it, and all I needed was to attach the power wire. After that, I placed the ink cartridges in, which was easy to put.

Installation
This was very challenging. I probably ran installation around 15 times to get it right--yes 15. HP Smart easily detected the printer and hooked it up to my wifi, but the installation stops after that step. I switched installation between HP Smart and directly from windows settings (add printer option) using WPS direct and manual IP address adding but the connection won't go through. I suspect that it has something to do with 2.4ghz and 5ghz wifi signals, which, like my IOT devices that I set up has a hard time connecting with the network, where I suspect the printer communicates only using 2.4ghz. This was most of the pain, and it was brutal. Luckily it went through after the nth try. 

Print Output
Aligning was not that hard, as the scanning feature is easy so that I can align the heads. Printing was fairly fast and the quality is pretty good for a Deskjet output-- it was comparable to my LaserJet printer. One issue I had though was, there is almost no extension tray that holds the printed pages. It just throws them all out of the printer and onto the table. Luckily it I placed on a longer table, if not, it will just be throwing documents to the ground. Also, paper tends to double up every so often as it feeds onto the printer. It's a bit of a nuisance. Good thing is that the print speed is pretty fast.

Software
HP Smart has been a great tool for printing and I am glad it is integrated in this Deskjet model. As long as everything is set up, remote printing and ink replenishment is automatic. The app itself helps with printer tools like diagnostics and status. With the app on my phone and my tablet, I can easily print my documents from my devices.

This is a good printer for home use. It is not too complicated and is fairly easy to use—just have some patience with its quirks!",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,2,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,

You can do everything through your smartphone, so you don't even have.to fire up your PC. Set up wasn't so easy, however. The app used for set up kept hanging on me and then, for some odd reason, my WiFi simply wouldn't cooperate with this printer. After resting, resubmitting passwords and unplugging, somehow it finally all came together. It was very frustrating
 
The printer, once up and running will do your basics. Every process seems to take a while to get.going and the printing is a little on the slow side. Basic enough for occasional home use, but this wouldn't be a good printer/scanner for frequent use. I do like that I don't have to use my PC to print and can just use my phone. If you ever run into any issues, the app is helpful and will probably be your solution, even for ink maintenance.

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-01,uicc676,5,4-5-star,Good Value for the Price; Slow Print Speed,"This is an all-in-one wireless inkjet printer that requires Wi-Fi with internet access to setup and operate.  The printer comes with setup ink cartridges (presumably that means very low capacity) and a power cord. The printer has copy, scan, and print functions.

Setup is fairly easy, download the HP Smart app and it guides you through the setup. There are two options offered during setup: the HP Smart Plus program, and HP Instant Ink program.  Smart Plus gives you access to mobile printing and faxing, and HP Instant Ink sends you replacement ink cartridges as needed for a monthly fee.  The default ink program is 50 pages a month for $4.99/monthly, but you can change it to 10 pages per month for a $1.49/monthly. I recommend signing up for both programs but read the fine print.  If you cancel the Instant Ink, HP will disable your instant ink cartridges and you have to send them back and buy regular priced replacements. Note: for the Smart Plus app to work for mobile printing or faxing, you have to give the app phone permission.  It didn't do that automatically for me, I had to figure out why it wasn't working.

The print/copy/scan quality of this printer is good, but the print speed is slow.  It says on the box 7.5 black pages per minute and 5.5 color ppm.  I timed a 2-page black text document, and it took 19 seconds to complete. I timed that same document on another inkjet printer I have, and it took 9 seconds.  So, this HP printer is 50% slower.

The build quality of the printer is fairly typical - heavy gauge plastic, it weighs in at about 8.25 pounds.

Overall, this all-in-one printer is a pretty good value at its price point. There are some pros and some cons and something to take into account:

Pros:  Good print quality; remote printing/faxing; convenience - HPs Instant Ink program.

Cons: Slow print speed; requires HP ink cartridges (no budget brand will work).

Take into account: This printer is designed to be wireless only, you will lose some functionality if connected via USB cable.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,

Although you certainly could use it in a small office setting, I think it is better suited for occasional home use. Set up is simple once you download the needed app. No big surprises. Build quality matches the price point. It’s fine but feels a bit flimsy. But once you get it set up that really shouldn’t be an issue. Printed text is good. Crisp and clear. As for printing photos, it certainly can do it. But the limited number of ink tanks doesn’t give the photos the best quality. However, good enough for occasional photos. Three months of free ink is included thru the subscription that is available. I like the idea of a subscription service to keep you up to date with enough ink. But I don’t think most who will be looking at this model will be using it enough to need the subscription service. As for scanning, it does a decent job with 1200x1200 resolution. More than good enough for scanning notes, bills, receipts or other paperwork you may need to scan.

-------
Perfect companion for zoom calls when you are working from home. Sometimes when you are using headphones like the airpods or any other true wireless headphones, these are really geared towards music rather than phone calls. The other party can always hear background noise and also the volume is not that clear. its always better to use dedicated headphones for calls. If you work from home or are hybrid, and you dont want to be stuck to the desk on a wired headphone, this is it.

Pros
----
1. Excellent noise cancelling 
2. super range, i can walk around with this while connected to the phone or laptop
3. wife range Bluetooth
4. long battery life and standby

Cons
----
1. which they could make the Jabra elite headphones sound like this


Details
--------

I charged this fully before use. Its easy pairing for the laptop or the phone.  The call quality is excellent, and it is a super good range. I can be connected to a computer at 2nd level and still walk over to 1st level and be well connected.

The rated battery is 14 hours and standby is 17 days. I think the battery will last close to 12-13 hours.

of what is included in the box. There is a color cartridge, a black cartridge and warranty and quick setup literature. A long power cord
is included for power which is much appreciated. 

After removing the shipping tape, some peel off plastic covers and checking the setup guide - I plugged the printer in and 
installed the ink cartridges.  

Easy Setup - The software and driver package can be downloaded from HP which will walk you through setting up the wifi on the 
printer ( it broadcasts a generic network of it's own for setup ). The software will prompt you to connect to the printer's 
wifi for initial configuration, then attach it to the wireless network of your choice.

Hard Setup - For the I.T. Inclined, you can optionally connect the printer's setup network, substitute .1 at the end of the IP
Address you receive and put that in a web browser to access the web server setup based configuration. That also allows you to 
set a wireless network, turn on and off various printing protocols and enable or disable web based scanning. I went with this 
route to see if it was possible and was pleasantly suprised at the web interface and options. 

Overall Use - Once setup, I noted that the printer has various printing protocols enabled to allow it to be found by windows,
mac and android devices. I had no issue on windows, mac or on an Apple phone using airprint. It all worked seamlessly.

Color - It prints basic color quickly. I sent a few photos along at highest photo quality and the results
were out in under 60 seconds each. Notably these are prints that ""choke"" our megatank inkjet and take up to two
minutes each on another printer. Text and text with graphics process and print without any noticable delay. 

Scanning - Easy to use and adjust resolution and what formats to save output in. The printer also has a color 
and B&W Copy button. This is always more useful than I think it will be and saves a lot of time to make a quick
copy of something without involving a computer !

Onboard Display -  The onboard screen provides minimal info on printer status other than wifi state and a counter.

What I love-
- Supported Formats - Letter; legal; 4 x 6 in; 5 x 7 in; 8 x 10 in; No. 10 envelopes
- I was able to print from every device we own.
- 60 Sheet capacity which is generous enough for occasional printing. 

Could be improved - 
- The price of genuine ink tanks",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,3,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-03,stanmed,4,4-5-star,Great Printer for any Basic Print Jobs.,"I picked up HP DeskJet Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer (model #2855e) and have been pretty pleased with it. This is a very affordable solution for home use, for printing occasional documents and statements. It will be also used for home schooling needs, as our two kids always have worksheets to do and research papers to be printed out. This printer looks very basic, however it is pretty speedy and has features that you can always rely on like making copies and scanning documents. 
I like the Bonus feature that this printer is supplied with - 3 Free Months of ink and if you decide to sign up for HP printing subscription, I would highly recommend it as it will save you lots of money on buying ink. It is pretty easy to enroll and the plans start at very affordable rates. I have been using it for over 3 years now and I do not have any regrets or complains, my ink is shipped to me as soon as my printer gets low on it and I do not have to run to the store and spend $50 for a black ink cartridge.

If it is your first time setting it up, you will be pleasantly surprised, - HP has perfected the setup process. All you need is download HP Smart app and it will walk you step by step, get your HP Printer online and ready to go. 
Printing quality has been pretty good, I have not experienced any streaks and colors are vibrant and text looks crisp. One hint - the better your paper quality is the better your printed materials will look. 
I have not tried printing any pictures as I have another dedicated HP that does it well, but I would think it should do just fine. 
The printer is light weight too, so it is pretty easy to move it from room to room. 
All in all, it is a pretty basic printer which does printing well and the price is right too.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,1,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,
HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-04,MoniMouse,4,4-5-star,Great all in one printer for home or school.,"This HP DeskJet 2855e Wireless Printer, Scanner and Copier is a great piece of equipment to have for home or school. It copies and prints in black and white, or in color. The scanner is a flatbed scanner that scans a clear and accurate image of text, photos, business cards, and more. The printer takes two HP ink cartridges, one black, and one color. 

Setting it up: Setup was very easy, and took no longer than 5 minutes. I downloaded the HP application as per the setup guide, and followed all the steps. I didn’t even have to use a computer to do setup. I used my smartphone. It also seamlessly connected to my home WiFi. 

Ease of use: One of the greatest things about this device, is that it is simple to use. There are no complicated settings, although there is advanced functionality and printing. 

Scanning/copying: The flatbed scanner is as easy as opening a top, laying the page you want to scan or copy face down, and either pushing a button on the interface or in the application. You can scan to various file formats as well. 

Printing: The great thing about printing with this printer, is that it gives you options on quality, number of copies, size, and paper type. 

Pros: This printer does everything a student or home user needs. This is simple to operate. It’s wireless, so it can be used by everyone on the WiFi network. You don’t have to hook it to a computer. It can be placed anywhere in the home that has a good WiFi connection. You can use HP Instant Ink with this printer. 

Cons: It’s not slow, but it’s not super fast either. 

Summary: It is a good all in one printing device that is great for home or school.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,2,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,

My son recently has gotten into drawing and coloring more. I wanted something easy to use and could connect to my phone easily to print things quickly. He loves those books that teach you step by step to draw and has had fun tracing various things. It's been easy to find random coloring pages for him that relate to his interests and print them to keep him busy throughout the day now that school is out. The scanner seems to work OK, we've been using it to scan some of his drawings and I'd eventually like to make a slideshow or some type of digital way for him to keep his designs longterm. I feel like this is easy enough for just about anyone to use and loved that I could complete setup from my phone and not have to rely on my computer for those steps. I'm interested to see how long it takes before we need refills but if you want easy this is a great basic printer.

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-05-31,Manny,4,4-5-star,Great wireless printer with excellent app,"First off you will want to use the app for this because it makes literally everything you do with it to be much easier and better. It’s available for android and iPhone of course (it even works on iPad) but this really assists in telling you exactly how much ink is left and all your statistics about it along with sending faxes for free which is pretty cool. 

The printer itself is a very small footprint for a printer scanner copy combo unit which is extremely nice as I dont have a lot of desk space to begin with. 

This printer focuses heavily on wifi connection to do its work which is the new way to do things but it does well in my testing and I did not have any connection issues. Of course you can print directly off your phone itself or any windows / Mac computer and I did all 3 perfectly. The printing itself comes out crisp and colors are accurate not gross or wet like some can get. 

As far as the scanner goes it does okay here but honestly I feel like it should be better quality and no matter weather im using windows or my Mac machine they come out in what appears to be lower dpi than intended. This may possibly be updated in a later firmware update as it is mentioned in the paperwork they will send out updates to keep it most effective and security updated to ensure best performance. You can also use the phone app to use your phones camera to “scan” a document which is cool and actually comes out better in most cases if you have good even lighting. 

The ink right off the bat for me neither one was full but thats typically what happens with new printers so I cant fault it for that. They do use a program for ink if you print a lot or want peace of mind to have ink when you need it and there are options to go over once you set up to see if thats something you want to do. 

Overall a great budget printer that does all things well.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,1,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=6,2024-09-21,US,,

You will get 3 months of free ink upon registering for the package. The cost of the high-capacity cartridges is dependent on your printing volume. Set-up is completed by the HP app either on your phone or computer. The HP+ also comes with anywhere printing. The quality of the printouts is outstanding for this level of printing. However, the speed of printing is slow. The quality of the printouts is right up there, as the letters are clear and unblurred.  Pictures also print out without color bleeding. Utilizing the Best setting in the setup profile achieved this result. 
The scan function of the HP DeskJet 2855e leaves a lot to be desired. The scan function is achieved via the glass flatbed. Utilizing the scan function leaves a fuzziness to the text and pictures scanned. The scanning is limited to the application. 
The copy function of the HP Deskjet 2855e has the same ineffective output as the scan function.
The printer comes with standard startup print cartridges. I have used HP+ instant ink on all my HP printers.

So now I can print from anywhere and anytime and when I get home my stuff has already printed!!,,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,
HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-01,Patrick,4,4-5-star,HP Instant Ink Stands In The Way...,"I have been quite pleased with the HP DeskJet 2855e All-In-One printer. Why? Because it works exactly like its supposed to work… with NO hassles.

I first became an HP printer fan way back in the 90’s when I was introduced to laser printers via the LaserJet 1100. It was a no-nonsense workhorse that outshone all the competition. And so it is with this 2855e printer… it is a no-nonsense workhorse.

The setting up of the HP 2855e is unremarkably straightforward, simple, and intuitive. I say intuitive only because I’ve owned many HP printers over the years, and once you’ve set one up, you’re pretty much an expert. The downloadable HP Smart software app makes connecting to wi-fi simple and easy as well. And for the novice, HP includes a great quick-start guide.  I was able to connect to the printer using a different computer, and it was as easy as “Add Another Printer.” 

To be honest, I wasn’t expecting much in the way of “Wow!” factor when I tested the HP 2855e for text. I mean, how impressive can it be to print out a text document? However, the crispness and clarity of the print was truly outstanding. Even routine graphics are pleasing with their true colors, no bleeding, and sharpness. So there’s the first big plus, great text printing.  But what about photo printing? I was about to find out…

I do like the ability to control the output quality from the app/printer controls. In other words, HP doesn’t give you just a couple of minor menus to control print quality, but several. And of course, a lot of what goes into a good photo print is centered around good photo editing skills. Regardless, the proof is ultimately in how striking the final product is when you look at it. I sorted through several digital photos on my computer and chose several to print…my pet dog, a barren winter landscape, and an indoor photo. 

I wasn’t overly excited by the photo results. At best they are passable for everyday photo printing. But the prints came out a bit darker than the originals, and there wasn’t the super clean non-bleeding contrasts between colors. Even at the very highest settings available, the prints were only marginal. But in all fairness, the HP 2855e is designed to be used in the home/small office to handle everyday tasks. So as far as the photo printing is concerned, for what the HP is, the photo printing is absolutely fine. I will say this however…I did find the photo printing speed on the higher settings took significantly longer to print than the 5.5 PPM HP states. For the 4x6” prints, it took over one minute.  

For a very good, generalize, all-around home or home-office use, the 2855e is perfect. It’s relatively inexpensive, durable, and easy to use. One those conditions, I would heartily recommend the HP 2855e to anyone looking for a great little workhorse printer. But there is one subject I must bring up that would be the only thing standing in the way of recommending it without any caveats… the HP Instant Ink program.  With Instant Ink, you pay so much each month, depending on how many pages of printing you sign up for. For example, the lowest-priced plan covers up to ten pages of printing per month, for $1.49 a month. For text printing, the B&W cartridge should last approximately 12 months. Total cost for 12 months is approximately $18. Not bad as far as cost goes, but that’s exactly what you would expect to pay for a new cartridge at the store. There is no 50 percent savings as HP claims. Convenience is the only benefit. The problem lies in the fact that HP monitors which cartridges you use in their 2855e printer. HP will block any cartridge that is not HP original. So if you can buy a less-expensive replacement ink cartridge, it won’t work.  This one issue stands in the way of a truly great little printer.

All-in-all, in spite of the ink issue, I think the HP DeskJet 2855e would make a very good addition to any home or home-office environment that doesn’t require a lot of printing. It’s reasonably priced, and doesn’t take up a whole lot of room.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,2,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-03,zboot,2,1-2-3-star,Looks Good But Look Elsewhere for a Printer,"The HP DeskJet 2855e seemed like it would be the perfect home all-in-one printer. It can print in black/white and color, scan and copy. Supports a wireless connection in addition to USB and looks compact and sleek. Best of all, it even comes with 3 months of free ink! On paper and in person, this printer looks great. Unfortunately, that's literally the case. When it comes to actual use, one starts to discover a bunch of gotchas.

The first came with setting up the printer. Unboxing and getting things ready for wireless pairing is pretty straightforward. There isn't much here, just the printer and the protective plastic and a power cable. With no touchscreen, you're relying on the HP Smart app to configure the printer. No biggie though I don't really like vendor lock-in. While technically, this doesn't need to phone home to HP to work, if in the future, I change wifi and HP is out of business, I'm stuck with the less secure wifi direct connection method. Anyway, the pairing process failed on the first and second attempt. Guess the third time was the charm. In the process, I discover that the printer can only connect to 2.4Ghz networks. This is a limitation that I see on really small/cheap electronic devices or old ones. To be fair, this is a compact and cheap printer. In any case, I didn't think too much of it until my test print came out bad. 

Not slightly misaligned, but quite noticeably so. Hmm, ok, there's some calibration buried in the HP Smart menu which got things better. Noticeable on some prints, but ok. Maybe don't print 20 copies of your resume (print 30, then select the best 20). At this point, I've printed a bunch of things just in black and white. Checking out the ink level in the app, I see that I'm already around 75-80%. Hmm. I tried out a few color prints. They're of ok quality thought the paper definitely gets saturated if there's a lot of solid color. While print speed isn't that fast, and honestly, I don't care too much about waiting a minute for 6 pages, it seems like with this you'd want to avoid printing color photos back to back unless you're going to grab them immediately so the pages don't stack and potentially stick together.

So, while I feel fine about the print quality, I also see why HP right out of the gate is offering 3 free months of ink. At first I thought it was a gimmick, how am I going to use up enough ink where I'd be replacing any cartridge in 3 months. But if you have kids at home that still need to submit printed assignments or in generally are printing regularly for things in the home, you're likely going to actually be able to cash in on the offer.

So, at the end of the day, the printer functions. It can be set up, calibrated, and it works. But your router needs to support 2.4Ghz mode, you likely can't place this as far away as other devices, and you will burn through ink (I found in the manual that HP recommends powering off the printer when not in use to save toner).",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=6,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-06,Rudeney,3,1-2-3-star,Low-end basic printing,"I was looking for a very basic printer for my daughter to use for schoolwork.  I have a business-class color laser printer, but I don’t like her using it due to the cost of toner, plus it’s in my work-from-home office and I don’t need any distractions.  This printer looked like a good option as it has a small footprint, includes a scanner, and the ink is not terribly expensive.  The printer does look nice.  It’s very modern looking with simple control buttons.  I like that it uses an AC power cord instead of having to deal with an external transformer “brick”.  It has a USB connector for direct connection to a PC, and that’s what I thought I’d use so that it wasn’t taking up any Wi-Fi bandwidth.  Unboxing and physical setup was easy, but getting it up and running was not.

While I really like HP equipment and I have a laptop and two desktops, I have never been a big fan of HP printers.  They just don’t seem to be competitive in terms of value and quality.  For this one, I think it’s a good value and the quality is reasonable for the price, but HP has done something that I just find unforgivable.  Specifically, they require a smartphone app for setup.  Instead of just being able to plug the printer into the computer and go, it seems to require configuration via the app, and of course that process is full of plenty of advertisement for automatic ink re-ordering.  I know that the app can offer a good setup experience, but I am a bit old-school and prefer that this be done on my PC.  Also, I had several issues with the app and printer communicating and completing the setup.  It finally worked, but it was much more trouble than it was worth.

As for print quality, it’s decent.  The output is very good and on par with other inkjet printers I’ve used.  Photo quality is not great.  It’s OK for kids wanting to print out pictures to stick to a bulletin board, but that’s about it.  Photos are very slow to print and not worth the wait.  Printing text documents and simple graphics, it does a good job and is reasonably fast.  It is noisy and shakes a lot during printing.  The scanner is slow and the quality is not great.  It’s probably best for making a quick copy and not for scanning photos.  The paper feeder claims it holds 60 sheets, and that’s about right, but the output tray will begin to balk at more than 12 pages.  It will push existing pages out of the tray and so you loose collation.  

Overall, this is a typical low-end inkjet that’s acceptable for printing simple documents.  Its best features are its size and price, but when required to deal with HP’s confound “app” and lots of compromises, there are likely better choices, especially if you are willing to spend maybe $30 more.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=6,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-04,SciFiFan,4,4-5-star,Nice little printer and scanner,"The HP Deskjet 2855e is a pretty simple all-in-one device. It's easy to setup and use. I've setup dozens of printers over the years and could probably do it with ny eyes closed so I had my daughter set it up to see how easy it is.

She didn't have any problems. She followed the instructions, setting it up one her home network with her cell phone. She loaded the HP Smart app, unpacked the printer, plugged it in, and turned it on. HP Smart found the device, configured it's wi-fi, and went through the options for HP Instant Ink subscription. We decided against the plan because it will be lightly used and I don't see the need for a monthly usage fee.

The printer is pretty basic. It prints at about 7.5 ppm in black and white, and 5.5 ppm in color. It has 2 ink cartridges. One is black and the other is cyan, magenta, and yellow. The black cartridge is rated for 100 pages and the color for 120 pages. High yield cartridges are available that print 200 pages black and white and 240 pages color. 

Paper is input in the back and it holds 60 pages. It has a 25 page output tray. It also has a flatbed scanner for making copies and scanning.

It's a nice little printer for light usage. You don't get very many pages from the ink cartridges. At least they are relatively inexpensive to replace. Having all three colors in a single cartridge can be an issue because as soon as any of the colors runs out, you need to replace it regardless of how much ink is left of the other colors. The print quality is good and they have a simple alignment procedure using a special printed page and the scanner.

For light home usage,  I can recommend this printer.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,1,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-03,Bruce,4,4-5-star,Print essentials,"The printer marker has gotten more complex. Different forms of ink, huge LED touchpad screens with lots of different options and features, there are a lot of things to consider. For some, some of that may be too much. Some people just want a simple printer. For them, the HP DeskJet 2855e meets their requirements.

Setup for the DeskJet 2855e was pretty simple. Download the app, connect to the printer, connect it to wifi, install the ink cartridges, and bam, you're set to go. I also had to create an account for HP+ to print from anywhere, I feel like that should be accomplishable without signing up for a program, but that's not a major deal. That program also provides you 3 months worth of ink for free, seeing as I don't print a ton, I'll see how that works out. 

Design is simple. Slide the paper through the back for printing, lift the top to scan/copy. The printer is relatively small, so it won't take up a ton of space. The overall look is basic. No huge screen, not a million buttons, it's not made to stand out, it's made to print.

As for printing quality, it's solid. Using ink over laser, it obviously takes longer to print. Printing anything other than words, it's, ok. It gets the job done, but I wouldn't print a picture book using this printer. 

The DeskJet 2855e doesn't have the flash and flair some of the other printers in the market have, but if you're looking at this printer, you know that already, and are more than likely trying to avoid all the extras.

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-05-30,Akire,4,4-5-star,Quality Prints but Subpar Scans,"This is a great budget printer for someone who needs something simple but provides quality printouts. The quality of the output is great, and the colors are true and vibrant to the original. When used under the “best” setting, the prints are almost photo quality.

Construction
The unit is extremely lightweight and easy to move around. Some parts of it feel flimsy but they are tougher than they feel. The main part that feels this way is the output tray, it feels jammed whenever I am pulling it down and like it might break, but it takes some tough love and just snaps down with a little force. The buttons also have a budget feel to them and make a loud click but work just fine. Besides that, it is a compact unit that does not take up much space. 

Set-Up
Setup is a breeze. Once it is plugged in and the HP Smart app is downloaded to a phone or computer, it will give step by step instructions to follow and complete the process and connect it to the network. It took me less than ten minutes to get it going. 

Print
The print quality is exceptional as noted above. Words are printed with clarity and crispness. Colors are true to the screen. Nothing is strayed or frayed. The “best” setting makes a beautiful printout with increased saturation and vividness. Time from click to print is about ten seconds with the “normal” quality setting. 

Ink
The included ink cartridges do drain fast. I have printed about 10 pages and my color ink levels are estimated at around halfway drained already, while a fourth of my black has been used. HP has a monthly subscription included that replenishes the ink automatically by shipping it out to you as needed with the first three months being free. The printer sends the information to the account, so HP knows how many pages you have printed as the subscription is determined by page usage. There are also options for higher yield ink so that it does not finish as fast for those that prefer not to subscribe. 

Scans
The scan is only done through the flatbed, and it is subpar. There is a grainy quality to them and a textured appearance even when set to the highest resolution.

App
The HP Smart app is great for many reasons. It gives the ink levels right up front so that it is easy to keep track of. I can easily print from my computer or phone. Along with that it allows for faxes to be sent free, a great addition as I need it occasionally and have no other way of doing so. Along with that there are other uses for it, such as allowing scans to be done through the phone’s camera. So far, the app has not given me any pop-ups or annoying pushiness to use their ink subscription services.

Extras
HP has made the printer with self-healing Wi-Fi that prevents its printer from losing connection to the network as is the frustrating case with some printers. I really like that about HP because I have had many printers with such issues. 

Conclusion
I really like this printer for occasional use. Its print quality is great, but it uses up ink too quickly in my opinion. I do not recommend this for anyone who plans to use it to scan anything where the quality is important, such as photos. Besides that, it is a great budget-friendly printer.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,1,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-01,CoppinFam,4,4-5-star,Simple Design (YAY!),"In the box is the printer, two ink cartridges (color and black), power cord and a setup guide/a letter from HP, limited warranty flyer, instant ink flyer and reference guide.

First Impression - I love the simplicity of the design of this printer. I have so many other printers that have multiple cords, and a printer panel to operate the printer and so on and so forth.

Setup - The setup of the printer is VERY simple. You take off the tape, plug in the power cord and press the on button and that’s it.

The HP Smart App - The HP Smart App to me is still a problem child. I am a previous owner of a HP printer and thought that maybe the app would have gotten better over the years. The app still looks the same from my last printer that I got a couple years ago, so the setup was very familiar. I am not sure if it was my connection or my human error but it took me a couple tries to get the printer fully complete the setup process. I started with the IOS HP smart app and after a few tries, I switched over to my PC. I downloaded the app and after installing the printer about 3-4 times, I finally got the green ready status and I was able to print. (I was not able to print until the initial processing was completely done.) I would like to add that the other features of the app like printing cards and coloring pages will be really helpful for upcoming birthdays and Father’s Day, so I plan to use that feature a lot. The support feature of the app is helpful too as I was able to find information on how to reset the printer and other helpful hints with installation.

Printing - The printer to me works as expected. I am to print black and white and color pages. The print quality is good so far as expected. The printer is a deskjet, so I don’t expect to get laser jet printouts.

I would like to note that there is a subscription for the HP ink that you get a 3 month free trial included with the printer. There is an option to get a notification 2 weeks before the trial ends to remind you of the upcoming charge or to cancel. I had the plan with my old HP and it was a great addition to my printer because it takes the guesswork out of buying ink for your printer. The cartridges they send you has a chip in them and when you ink reaches a certain level, it triggers a shipment for a new cartridge in the mail. You pay monthly for the amount of pages that you think you might use and you can change it if you think you might use more or less.

Overall, I am very pleased with this printer and I highly recommend setup with a PC. I would recommend to friends and family.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,2,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-03,Trobadour,4,4-5-star,Simple and Easy Printing,"--- SETUP ---
To set up this printer, download the HP Smart app to your phone. Connect the printer with the included power cable, turn it on, and the app will automatically find the printer for you.  Follow the app instructions to complete setup.  No PC required for setup or use.

--- FEATURES ---
All in one printer with 5.5 color pages per minute, 7.5 mono pages per minute, holds up to 60 papers in tray, holds up to 25 printed pages in output tray, mobile and PC printing, print from anywhere with link from app, 1200 x 1200 scanner resolution, auto-shut off, photo printing, 1 black cartridge and 1 color cartridge included, HP Instant Ink compatible.

--- EXPECTATIONS and PERFORMANCE ---
Setting up this printer is easy, but I ran into a problem where the app would indicate that my password was incorrect to connect to WiFi even though it wasn’t.  After a close and reopening of the app, the app didn’t ask me to setup again, it just accepted that setup had been completed.  

The app can guide you on how to install the ink.  The ink holders will move to the center of the printing area for you to install the ink.  All you have to do is push the ink cartridges in until you hear an obvious click.  After you complete app setup and run the alignment pages, you can use the app to replace an existing printer to your instant ink account or add the printer to your instant ink account.  If you add this as a second printer, you are given a 3 month trial.  If you replace it, your subscription continues as normal.  

The printer itself does a very good job at printing text.  The text comes out clear and crisp in both, color and monochromatic.  As far as printing colored documents or pictures, I chose to print in the highest quality for photos and the photos themselves come out pretty crisp as well.  Photos were printed on regular white paper.  If you have an instant ink account, you can print as much color as you want, as you are only deducted the # of pages you print, not the type of ink you use, which is great if you print a lot of color documents.

I used the scanning bed to test the scan.  Using your phone and the HP app, you can scan from your mobile device.  The app gives you a preview of the scan, but once you actually save the scanned image, it loses quality compared to the image that you scanned.  Scanning text works ok, but scanning images isn't a go for this printer.  

One of my most noticeable and favorite things about this printer is how silently it prints.  It is one of the most quiet printers I have ever used, and it is perfect for late-night printing.  

--- APPROVAL ---
This printer is ideal for small home needs, such as the occasional document printing or even a family or pet photo print here or there.  I wouldn’t recommend it for scanning, though. College students or a less tech savvy inclined person will appreciate its ease of use.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,2,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=1,2024-09-21,US,,
HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-03,btb2k,5,4-5-star,Simple and easy to use good printer and scanner!,"This printer was super easy to connect and setup all just with my phone and the HP Smart printing app and gets you going with free ink to try out the Instant Ink service which I'd also recommend. Gone are the days of needing a PC to print and scan with this printer (and really all of HP's printers) as the Smart app works great to get going with printing fast. I like this printer that it can scan using the App on your PC or phone/tablet and you can make copies right on the printer without a phone or PC which is handy to have from time to time. 

Print quality is good for both photos and everyday printing. I have another printer with these same cartridges and sometimes do have trouble with them clogging if they go unused for a long period of time but if they do, check out youtube for some videos on how to troubleshoot/fix that if following the head cleaning doesn't work. HP's help and tech support also recommends some of these same steps and the App does help troubleshoot which I'd try first especially if you're enrolled in to Instant Ink as they will help you (based on my last HP printer and this one seems to be the same in that regard).

The updated version of this printer is pretty much the same and so far the Wifi seems to be stable and has not disconnected which has been a problem with one of my older printers where it drops out from time to time and the only way to fix it is to unplug and plug it back in.

I think this is a great printer for everyday printing, especially if you are using it primarily for your kids and school work or projects. It would even be good for a small home office with the scan and copy functions though if you do any volume printing, there are other HP models better suited to that.

This has been a great printer so far and I like the refreshed version of it better as HP addressed things that I think make it more reliable and easy to use.",Badge: Tech Insider Network Member,,,,0,,,,,https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-deskjet-2855e-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-with-3-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white/6574145?variant=A&page=5,2024-09-21,US,,
HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Best Buy,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-06-02,BBReviewer,3,1-2-3-star,Simple printer for basic needs,"The HP DeskJet 2855e Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer is a basic, lightweight printer for your everyday needs. It does print, copy and scan. The setup is super easy and MUST be done by downloading the HP Smart app found at 123.hp.com. From there, just follow the prompts to set yourself up on your wifi and finish setup. This printer does not have a typical paper ""tray"" - the paper only loads from the rear. The ink installation was a bit confusing for me as I have never seen a ink access door before. I am used to the top of the printer opening up. You have to bend over to see inside the access door and figure out which ink cartridge goes in which spot. There is a multi-color cartridge and a black one - what comes with the printer are ""starter"" ink cartridges, so be prepared to get ink sooner rather than later. Another confusing thing is the HP Instant Ink. When you sign up for this subscription service they monitor your ink usage and send ink when they see you are getting low. There is a monthly fee for this based on your best guess of how many pages you will use each month. The box states you will get 3 months free Instant Ink to start, but once setup, it showed me I have access to only 2 months of free Instant Ink. I declined to sign-up at that point. Also, HP will update your printer automatically to make certain you are not using any ink other than genuine HP ink cartridges. It is my understanding that you can, however, refill the HP ink cartridges. 
As for the print quality, I would say that printing is absolutely acceptable, but it is slow. Oh, another quick point, this printer does NOT offer duplex printing. If you want to print on the back side of a paper, you must do that manually. Copying is a different story - the copy quality is much inferior to the printing. It is not nearly as dark in copy mode. 
There are some environmentally sound things HP has done with this printer: it is made with 60% recycled plastic; it is Energy Star and EPEAT certified.
All in all, I would say this HP DeskJet 2855e Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer would be useful for those using it infrequently or possibly school age children who wouldn't necessarily need duplex printing. It is quite basic but the printing quality is acceptable.
