So I ordered it. Unpacked it, everything looked great. Set it up and connected it with the power cable. Now the setup odyssey began. The setup app wouldn't install on my phone. A Huawei P10 is probably not enough. So I would have had to buy a new phone with a newer Android. Expensive option for setting up a printer. OK, we tried using WPS as per the instructions as an alternative. Needless to say, the next few hours were marked by running to the ground floor router, setting it to WPS, then back up to the printer, turning it on at the computer (because after 90 seconds without entering WPS, every new attempt is invalid and the computer has to be restarted). There was no WPS ID to be found anywhere on the printer, there was nothing in the instructions but no information about WPS, and nothing was shown on the crappy display either. My anger grew with each attempt... The app on the computer sent me to a paid subscription for drivers... After hours, I had had enough of it. By now my hourly wage would have far exceeded the price of the printer. Packed up and sent to DHL. Tip: Don't send it to DHL on the same day. The return code is on Amazon, but that doesn't mean that DHL will accept it as a code. Conclusion: Contrary to the test reports, this printer is a failure.

Also all scans were crooked in the same way (incorrect or absent calibration of the scanning light...). The scans were worse than the old (similar) printer and eliminated all the colored shades, except red and black. Basically they were scans with totally incorrect exposure, perhaps oriented to photocopies of texts but to be thrown away for any image. Finally we are at only 300 dpi, when the model (as I said similar) reached 1200 Dpi 15 years ago. I tried to print an altimetric map and it missed all the grays of the PDF, printing only the lines.

However, after using it for a while, I'm pretty disappointed and regret the purchase. While the printer is fine in terms of features (printing, scanning, copying, and Wi-Fi), the running costs are ridiculously high. The cartridges are extremely expensive and seem to run out much faster than expected. After doing the math, I found that the price per page is more expensive than getting it printed at a local store! For anyone who prints regularly, this is a complete rip-off. The included HP Instant Ink may sound like a good deal at first, but after the free period ends, it becomes another ongoing expense. For a budget printer, the cost of ink completely undermines the supposed savings. I wouldn't recommend this printer to anyone who values ​​long-term cost efficiency. It may work for occasional users, but if you only print moderately, it's cheaper and less stressful to go to the print shop.

Again, several hours wasted before it finally worked properly. Conclusion: HP and their ink policy are really annoying, it's just uncomfortable and ultimately not recommended.

This is the case with MagentaZuhause users, whose WLAN works at 5.xGHz. In this case, the HP software cannot be loaded using WLAN. The patient HP technician knows the problem and loads the software onto the PC, cell phone or iPad accordingly. The provider's support then has to set up a separate WLAN access with 2.4 GHz. This takes an additional 30 minutes. In the end, 45 minutes are spent on HP support. PLUS 30 minutes of provider support = a total of 75 minutes passed until everything was running smoothly, at least with processing time restrictions of 2-3 minutes per HP print or HP scan. After about 11:30 p.m., HP applications become significantly faster because some batch run at HP is running, which then completely (!!) registers the new HP software user on the systems. Only the HP ink purchase program runs perfectly from the first minute after the software starts. Judge for yourself! Clarify the ""GHz problem"" before buying.

This year, for a single specific project, I needed to print a series of documents in photo quality and I decided to buy this one, because I have had HP products that have turned out very well, and I thought that things would have improved. Serious mistake. In my case, the installation was without problems via cable. It started well. I made five high-quality prints, A4 size, three of which came out damaged (only two colours, with lines and no definition). We waited a month and turned it on again today. I tried to make a print with generic photo paper and, by chance, the carriage got stuck and didn't accept it. I changed to normal paper and printed a print, which came out in two colours because it no longer had red ink, although the app shows that there is still enough. Another print to throw away. I tried to sign up for the three-month free trial of consumables and there is no way. Neither from the mobile app nor from the PC, it enters a loop that forces you to enter the data over and over again and, coincidentally, it does not detect the printer. It is impossible to do so. Two hours wasted of my time. In short, two literally half-decent prints, but without going off rockets and the color cartridges empty, free trial of cheaper cartridges impractical (reason why I chose this model, precisely), printer already giving problems in the cart but, yes, all my data on my wifi network usage (downloads, pages visited, third-party cookies, etc.) and name, address, phone, etc., well compiled in the HP database.

Has the Federal Cartel Office ever looked into this? Collective customer rip-off by the major printer providers??? I'm going to give the useless carrot away (to unwanted friends) and buy a printer that belongs to me. With which I can print whenever I want. Which can still be operated using a decent display.

The initial installation can only be done with the HP Smart app. They ask you if you want to register for HP+ to get some kind of benefit (to have your personal data, basically), then if you want to create an HP account (without the +) to be able to ""enjoy"" a subscription to Instant Ink. Not everything, thank you. And so far so good. The problems start when you realize that you can only print or scan from the app if you have an HP account. If not, you have to figure it out yourself. From the PC, Windows has no problem printing and scanning without the app. From the iPhone you use AirPrint (to scan I was only able to do it via the web, and it wasn't easy) and from Android I downloaded the Morpia printing and scanning apps (free and without having to create an account or give any information). Another big problem I found is that you can basically only print using wifi. It doesn’t work with a cable and with Wi-Fi Direct you need a code that you only get by printing a sheet. The damn code changes every time you connect and is only valid for 120 seconds. In other words, you waste the little ink in the cartridges printing this little number. A complete scam. More problems. The day after installing the printer, halfway through printing the enormous amount of 2 sheets (!!) the printer disconnected from the network. According to Windows the error was “driver not available”. According to the printer and after printing a 3-sheet report (what a nice scam to waste ink with useless information) everything was fine. To reconnect it I had to reinstall the HP app (I deleted it as soon as I finished the initial configuration… how naive of me, to think that everything was going to work fine) and configure everything again. A real shame and a waste of time. The print quality is average, but that is to be expected for the price and being a low-end printer.

The quality of prints, scans, and copies is outstanding, although it does seem to use quite a bit of ink (I used 2 black cartridges in 3 weeks, printing only about 100 pages). The real letdown, however, is the HP “Smart” setup software. I couldn’t get it to work over Wi-Fi, and every time I tried to reinstall the printer, different problems arose. I couldn’t even get it to work using a USB cable. Finally, I went back and installed HP’s previous setup software, HP Printer Assistant, and got it to work using a USB cable. But why buy a printer with Wi-Fi if it needs a cable to work? Plus, you can’t set it up with either app without a USB cable. Both apps require the use of a cable because the printer doesn’t have a touchscreen, and this information isn’t mentioned on the outside of the box, forcing me to make a second trip to buy a cable. Since HP knows that you need a cable to set it up, they should either include one with the printer or at least clearly warn about the need for it.

If you want it, as I said, to print from time to time, it's fine, but be aware that the cartridges that come from the factory have more air than a bag of chips, that is, 10% is ink, the rest is wasted space. Great deal...!! The printer works well, the quality is good, but it eats ink and this in the end is a ruin if you don't use refillable cartridges... Before this one I had a smarttank that died with the ink levels at full (the one it came with) and it printed several quixotes, incredibly profitable, but a potato in terms of quality.

HP DeskJet 4220e,No,Tassel Plus,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA MG3620,2024-02-28,Arenas,4,4-5-star,Simple and functional printer for everyday use,"💢 It looks great, and you can tell from the details and finishes that we have a well-established brand like HP behind it.💢 It's a mid-range product that does a good job for what it costs. Don't expect this printer to give you very high-quality reproductions, but for basic text and graphic documents, it does a perfect job. But even if you need to print photos, it doesn't disappoint either. The colors are vivid and the images come out quite sharp.💢 Another plus is how compact it is. It doesn't take up half your desk, which is great if you have limited space. And its sleek, minimalist design won't look out of place anywhere you put it.💢 This model is compatible with HP's instant ink program, so based on what you print per month, you can set up supplies to be delivered to you automatically so you don't run out of ink at the worst possible time. Anyway, I'm not really interested in it personally, as I prefer to decide for myself when I really need a replacement cartridge. ✪ CONCLUSION:⭐ A good option to consider. It's not the most sophisticated on the market, but it does what it promises: printing, scanning and photocopying without complications. 💬 I hope this little review has been useful to you. 👀",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Impresora sencilla y funcional para el día a día,

You can also connect wirelessly from your PC via a WiFi network, I have done this by downloading the drivers from the HP website itself.⚡ It is simple and intuitive to use.

Simó,5,4-5-star,Professional quality and features at an unbeatable price,"It is a fairly complete multifunction printer but basic in terms of finishes and features, which makes it perfect for home users without great demands on use. But from what has been said it should not be understood that it is a printer with little capacity, since it is at the level of the higher ranges in terms of quality of prints or scans. It is about differences in speed, capacity of the trays or manual double-sided jobs. The printer conforms to the images of the seller, with a modern design and easily associated with the brand. Due to its characteristics, it is perfect for domestic environments, so we gave it to our nephew, who occasionally came to have us print class work for him and he is the one who has been testing it and has sent me his impressions. The printer is delivered with user manuals, configuration, power cable, inks and guarantees. In this model we do not have borderless printing available for photographs, although these are very small. It allows the use of paper in various sizes and finishes. The printing resolution is 300 dpi, a resolution used in most professional printing. It uses only two ink cartridges, one black and one with the three primary colours, so it is difficult to take full advantage of the 3 colour inks. In compensation, HP has some tight prices on this type of cartridges. The scanner is a flatbed type with a sheet feeder. It does not scan double-sided automatically. The scanner optics are capable of scanning up to 1200 dpi at 24 bits, sufficient for most uses. The printer screen and buttons are somewhat sparse, but sufficient considering that we have full control from the mobile or computer. This equipment is integrated into the HP Smart application, which allows printing from anywhere. The installation of the printer is extremely simple by following the steps in the application. Its Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to locate it without depending on network cables. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, CromeOS, Android and iOS. In the case of Windows, macOS, Android and iOS, it is very simple to use. Installation is very simple. I have several HP printers in my account and the aforementioned application, all installed without any problem, and in this case my nephew was able to create his account and install it without help. One of the advantages that HP offers is the “Instant Ink” service, with which we receive ink replacements directly at home whenever we need them, at reduced prices. This service is interesting if we print regularly every month. In order to evaluate its usefulness, we have 3 months of trial (prior subscription). As a possible disadvantage compared to other models, we have that it does not recognize third-party inks, or rather it recognizes that they are not original and refuses to print. This is the result of HP's policy of ensuring the highest quality and durability of the printer.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=3&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Funciones y calidad profesional a precio imbatible,

You just have to follow the instructions that come with the product and in a few minutes you can start printing. A big difference with other printers, I think of a Canon that we bought for my parents' house and that was a real pain when it came to setting it up. This one, in that aspect, has been really simple. And the best thing is that it can be configured to be visible from computers, by cable or wifi, but also from mobile phones, and so we save ourselves from having to send a file from the mobile to the computer just to print it. The quality and speed of printing are acceptable, taking into account the price of the product.

I was looking for a simple and inexpensive printer, and this one fit my needs of what I was looking for. It is not a printer with many pretensions, it has a compact and aesthetically beautiful design, which integrates without clashing in any work or study space. Its configuration is simple, its interface is quite intuitive. It has connectivity through USB 2.0, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. The start-up is simple and fast; in minutes we are printing from any mobile device or computer at home. The print quality for being one of HP's low-end models is very correct. It has a resolution of up to 1200 x 1200 dpi for black and white documents and 4800 x 1200 dpi for color prints. Everything I have printed, both images and text, are printed with clarity and sharpness. It has been useful for both documents that I print daily as drafts and also for more important projects that required better resolution. The printer is multifunction and also includes a built-in scanner with a quality comparable to that of the print. The printer comes with the addition of HP Instant Ink, a service that I did not know about and I personally found very interesting. Since, through a subscription system, it guarantees that you never run out of ink, sending cartridges to your home before they run out. However, not everything is perfect, the truth is that I have noticed that the speed of sending documents to the printer is somewhat slow, although once the printing process begins, the speed is completely acceptable. When purchasing, you must also take into account that, despite its compact design, it is necessary to have enough space behind the printer to operate the scanner and change the cartridges comfortably. In short, a very competent printer for those like me looking for a multifunction printer for home use or for small offices. It has a very balanced quality-price ratio, and they also do not give away 3 months of Instant Ink. I hope that my comments 📝 are useful 👍 and entertaining.

Great value for money.,"The HP DeskJet 4220e Multifunction Printer is a good product for printing documents, scanning and copying, and in both areas it more than meets the quality requirements. It is quite easy to install, with an intuitive process that is well explained in the instruction manual. The ink cartridges (black and colour) can be placed before this process or after finishing. I use it wirelessly via WiFi, since we have several computers at home and so it is available to all members, and we also have it located in a convenient place where there is not one of these computers nearby, but to complete the information it can also be connected via USB to a computer. The wireless connectivity is also very good and has not caused a single problem so far. It also has mobile printing capabilities, but the print quality will be lower than if you print from a computer, where it offers up to 1200 x 1200 dpi. The sheets are fed automatically and vertically, and it has a capacity for 35 sheets. It has a reasonable printing speed, in this respect it is somewhat slower than another somewhat older HP toner printer that I have, but this is logical since this HP DeskJet 4220e is an inkjet printer. Even so, it is not a nightmare to print with it. I still have to activate and try the 3 free months of the Instant Ink printing service with HP+, for which 3 months are initially offered for free. This promotion must be activated within a week of starting up the printer. We are not the type to print documents all day long, but at least I will make use of those 3 months and evaluate whether it is worth it. For those who print a lot, it is undoubtedly a great saving option. ✅ In general and for the price it has, it is a very good and effective multifunction printer in each of its sections.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the Instant Ink service, as I think it's a bit of an abusive service, ignoring the three month trial period they give you after this, now that they've raised the prices again, it seems expensive to have to pay €5 a month to print 30 pages, as it's cheaper to go to a stationery store and have them print almost everything. The worst thing about this service is not when you have it, but when you unsubscribe, as all the cartridges you have that you've already paid for you can't even use them, they stop working directly and you have them left but they're useless. In short, I think it's a good printer but its abusive subscription systems make me prefer another type.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Sin alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/HP-DeskJet-2820e-Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n/product-reviews/B0CFFWJHMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Impresora perfecta para casa si no fuera por Instant Ink,

HP DeskJet 2820e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-01-22,Ana A.P.,3,1-2-3-star,Think carefully about whether you are interested before signing up for Instant Ink,"At home we don't usually need to print a lot of things, but I thought that a printer like this could save us trips to the stationery store to print odd things. But honestly I don't know if I was right. These types of printers are cheap, relatively easy to set up (this one is a bit of a pain with the wifi, but oh well) and to use. The printing is average for my taste, but maybe because at work I use much better printers. But the problem is the cartridges: - the ones that come with the printer are much smaller than normal, they give you 4 or 5 sheets and that's it - then you can use the 305 or 305XL (the XL ones cost twice as much as the normal ones), or compatible ones if the printer recognises them and you have never used the Instant Ink service. In any case, if you don't print at least once a week, you have to bear the idea that they will run out. - if you sign up for the Instant Ink service, they will send you the cartridges when the ones you have installed are running out. The printer must always be connected to the wifi. You get 3 months free, and I guess an extra one if you sign up using any of the codes posted in other reviews. But to get those 3 free months you have to subscribe within 7 days of setting up the printer (I don't understand the rush). Then you have several plans to choose from: 10 sheets for €0.99, 50 sheets for €3.99, etc. But oh, they just raised it to €1.49, €4.99, etc. I don't print even 10 sheets in a normal month; then the unprinted ones accumulate for the following month up to a maximum of 30. But if the printer decides to be silly and print half the pages, they count as printed. And if you go over the number of printed pages, you pay for another pack of 10 sheets, the same as for the subscription. And the day you cancel, the cartridges stop working even if they are full; you have to buy other ones (original HP, of course) to keep printing. In short, I think that the cartridges don't last very long (if you don't use them often they dry out) and they are expensive. And I don't like not being able to use compatible cartridges. I only see the Instant Ink service as reasonable if you usually print a more or less fixed number of pages each month. For occasional users, I don't think the service or the printer is worth it (because the cartridges will dry out if you don't use them). In my case, I have configured it but I haven't signed up for Instant Ink. When I run out of cartridges, I'll see if I can give it to a family member who will use it more.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Sin alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/HP-DeskJet-2820e-Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n/product-reviews/B0CFFWJHMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Piénsate bien si te interesa antes de apuntarte al Instant Ink,

It is a multifunction printer from the HP brand and specifically the DeskJet 4220e model, which is one of the newest from the brand. The printer has the capacity to print, scan and copy, which makes it very versatile, since we can carry out all these tasks without needing additional devices. One of the features that we liked the most is that it has an automatic document feeder, so we can load a good batch of sheets into the printer, and it will take them one by one to scan or copy them automatically, which is very convenient. Another very notable aspect is that it has WIFI connectivity, so we can print documents directly from any mobile device or tablet without cables (I have used it with Android and iOS), this feature is very convenient, so we do not have to have the printer connected to a computer and depend on it to print. Regarding the print quality I have to admit that it is really good, it is a fast printer and when we use it with photo paper the result is spectacular, I have used several brands of printers and I have to admit that HP is one of those that offer the best quality. Regarding blacks, it offers a resolution of up to 1200 x 1200 dpi and with color, the resolution reaches up to 4800 x 1200 dpi, and when printing it almost makes no noise, which is appreciated especially if you print jobs at night. On the other hand, this HP printer offers what they call the “Instant Ink” service, with this service we can receive ink directly at home before we run out, since the printer detects that we have little ink left and automatically sends the request to HP. This service is not only very convenient but also much cheaper than having to buy the cartridges ourselves, which are really quite expensive. To get to know the service, the printer comes with 3 free months of the same, which is great, we can choose the highest printing option during those 3 months and then change it to the one that suits our needs, according to our printing rhythm.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Muy buena calidad de impresión y fácil de usar,

Setup was very easy, just following the instructions on the screen and in the HP Smart App, which guided me step by step. The printer quickly connected to my Wi-Fi network and my mobile, and I was able to start printing straight away. Print quality is very good, both in black and white and colour, and text and images are crisp and vibrant. Print speed is also quite good, and I haven't noticed any jams or misfeeds. The scan and copy function also works very well, and the automatic document feeder is very handy for scanning or copying multi-page documents. Scan quality is good, and you can adjust the size, format and resolution from the HP Smart App. The mobile fax function is also very useful, as it allows you to send scanned documents from your mobile to any fax number, without needing a phone line. The HP Smart App also lets you print documents from the cloud, email, or social media, as well as monitor ink levels and printer status. The printer has a sleek, compact design that doesn't take up much desk space. The control panel is intuitive and easy to use, with a 2.2-inch monochrome LCD display that shows printer options and messages. The input tray has a capacity of 60 sheets, and the output tray has a capacity of 25 sheets, which is fine for home or small office use. The printer also has a quiet mode, which reduces noise when printing, which is appreciated if you work in a quiet environment. Like any printer, it has its advantages and disadvantages: Advantages- It is a multifunction printer that can print, scan, copy and send by mobile fax in black and white and in color.- It has a good print quality and speed, and allows manual double-sided printing.- It has a 35-sheet automatic document feeder, which makes it easy to scan and copy multiple pages.- It has a dual-band Wi-Fi connection with automatic reset, Wi-Fi Direct, high-speed USB 2.0 and Apple AirPrint, which allow printing from different devices and sources.- It has the HP Smart App, which allows you to print, scan and manage the printer from your mobile or tablet.- You have the option to choose HP +, which offers an additional year of warranty, three months of Instant Ink included and automatic ink delivery at home with the Instant Ink service.- It has a compact and elegant design, and an intuitive and easy-to-use control panel.- It has a quiet mode, that reduces noise when printing. Disadvantages- Double-sided printing is manual, meaning you have to turn the paper over and feed it back into the printer to print the other side.- The LCD screen is monochrome and small, which can make it difficult to see some options or messages.- The capacity of the input and output trays is limited, which may require frequent refilling of paper if you print a lot.- The HP+ option requires an HP account, a persistent Internet connection, and exclusive use of Original HP Ink for the life of the printer, which may limit the user's freedom of choice.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Una solución práctica con ventajas y desventajas.,
HP DeskJet 2820e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-01-21,Jose Antonio & family,2,1-2-3-star,What a way to complicate your life!!!,"We have received this HP printer that when you get it for the 50 euros that it costs you think what a marvel it is for only 50 bucks, so well presented, with that whole thing of having ink at home for 3 months, that it works via WiFi, that it doesn't need cables... in other words, it's a marvel. Well, none of that, so I'll tell you about my experience. The printer reminds me a lot of the one I also have from HP for many years, which is a 1050 identical in design to this one, which does the same thing as this one, print, copier, and scanner. It's not that it's a marvel at making photographic prints, but for what it cost me at the time, which is more or less the same as this one, you can't ask for more, apart from the fact that I don't need a photographic printer, and if I want photos, they'll be made for me in a copy shop with a higher quality printer. I only want it for the daily battle, and for my children to draw some pictures to colour, and with this my 1050 and this one that I have received it works well. Therefore as a printer or scanner it works correctly for the price it has, I would say that it is 50 euros well invested. Now the bad thing... 1- The configuration is by wifi, yes or yes, because the engineer on duty got it into his balls that it had to be like that, because he felt like it, and then he will complain that we give him bad scores. Well, doing it by wifi is a pain, since it can be done in a moment, as happened to me with the computer, or it becomes a mess as happened to me with my daughter's laptop, or something complicated with my son's tablet. I haven't even tried it with the mobile. Apart from the fact that when you do it it is very unstable and gets misconfigured... a pain. Was it so difficult to put a cable to the USB and make it a plug and play? Was it so difficult to do this? As I said before, it is a copy of the HP 1050 and I have never had any configuration problems or anything like that. 2- The inks at home, very well, but NO, THANKS. That thing about giving my credit card, my data, and who knows what else they control me with the software, what happened? Let's see if one day I print a photo of a naked girl and they send the moral police to my house. I'll pass. Also, if you give them and forget to unsubscribe, you will get a withdrawal of money in your bank account that will make you wonder,,, what is that? Well, this.

HP DeskJet 4220e,No,Tassel Plus,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA MG3620,2024-01-21,Entheris,2,1-2-3-star,"Very basic printer, printing is expensive.","The printer comes with a power cable, a black and a sample colour ink cartridge, and various manuals and quick guides in various languages. It is a very basic printer for home use, which takes up a considerable amount of space on the desk. It is easy to set up, everything is done through the ""HP Smart"" application from a mobile phone or a PC. The most convenient way is to connect it using a Wi-Fi connection, the printer is only compatible with networks that are in the 2.4 GHz band (this is a drawback, nowadays 5 GHz networks are fully extended and are much faster). Between the application and the printer they tell you all the steps to complete the configuration. If you connect it via USB to a PC, the configuration is even simpler. As soon as you start it up, it gives the impression (to me at least) that the printer is nothing more than an excuse to end up with a subscription service with HP for the supply of ink, with prices that are almost laughable. The most basic is a monthly print of 10 pages for 0.99€, go crazy! The most expensive, 300 pages per month for 24.99€, if you exceed the contracted price, you know, you have to pay extra. It's ridiculous. You get 2 months free (the third month is the cartridges that the printer already has), after verifying a valid payment method, once those two months have passed, you have to pay until you cancel the subscription. We all know the policy that HP is following with compatible cartridges, however, during the printer configuration it warns you that if you use those types of orange cartridges from China, they will reject them through firmware updates, and that a cartridge works for you today does not mean that it will continue to work for you tomorrow because their intention is to limit the use of these cartridges. With this message all my interest in the printer disappears. Logically you can ignore all these messages and buy the ink cartridges when you need them, if you buy the original ones, you have to assume that they have liquid gold inside, because they are not cheap (that's what happens when you change the print head every time you change the cartridges). As for the operation of the printer, well, as I said before, it is very basic, it scans, copies, prints, in black and white, in colour, at an acceptable quality, but above all very slow. Using Wi-Fi printing a 20-page document is a pain, it takes forever to start printing, and most likely it will fail halfway through the printing (remember that it is using the 2.4 GHz network). Using USB things improve a little, but not much, it is more stable when printing and faster to start printing, but the speed does not improve. The same goes for scanning. I think there are better options on the market than this printer for home use, especially models that are just as capable as this one at a similar price that can use compatible cartridges. Although my recommendation is to go for models like the Ecotank, Megatank or similar, the printer will be more expensive, but over time you will save on ink. Note: If you are only going to print 10 pages a month, it is better to go to a copy shop and print them there, it is not worth buying any printer.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,"Impresora muy básica, la impresión sale cara.",

I really like the 'subscription' option to avoid running out of ink, it's nice and convenient. You can choose different prices and adapt it to your needs. However, this month the prices are going up 😒. It's not at all quiet and not extremely fast either. And in optimal printing it's very, very slow 😅. But the prints are great.

HP DeskJet 2820e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-01-18,Eduardo,1,1-2-3-star,"Plug & play Terrible, the worst printer NOT ONE MORE HP IN MY HOUSE","BUT IT IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD, nothing else from HP fits in my house even if it were free. I don't like it, it makes life too complicated to install it. Someone who doesn't like technology at all would have to go around in circles too much to install it correctly, it has been easier for me to configure it with EWS than with HPSMART, something as simple as this cheap printer should be plug and play and that's it, the USB gives too many installation problems and the wifi network gives an IP range that is not usual and of course lay people have no idea how to find out. It is by far the slowest printer I have ever had but hey, it is cheaper than a carton of tobacco and the cartridges are cheap, I didn't intend to have a good printer but something that even my mother could configure. It's possible that having another HP before made it a bit complicated with the old one but I was prudent enough to uninstall it before but not even then, in the end through EWS and I configured it from the web services before HPSMART recognised it and configured it correctly. EDIT: It's getting worse, it's rubbish, it always appears as disconnected and forces you to print as an external printer over the Internet, cheap and useless, I'm going to discard it and buy another one from another brand, we can't waste time printing a one-page document. And the artificial retardation chat is to piss and not drop a drop, I haven't seen a more useless bot than the one for supposed technical assistance, this thing about artificial intelligence instead of people is ridiculous, it's not very intelligent.",,Compra verificada,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Sin alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/HP-DeskJet-2820e-Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n/product-reviews/B0CFFWJHMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=5&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,"Plug & play Nefasto, la peor impresora NI UNA HP MAS EN MI CASA",
HP DeskJet 4220e,No,Tassel Plus,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA MG3620,2024-01-17,Myself,4,4-5-star,Printer for occasional use,"Without being a high-end printer, it has everything you need, scanner, photocopier, prints in black and white and color, prints double-sided manually, remember that it is a low-end printer, it connects easily via Wi-Fi, you can print from your mobile, the sheet loading tray has a capacity of 35, for having so many functions, it is not very exaggerated in size, and it prints acceptably. The drawbacks that I find with this printer are mainly two, the one that bothers me the most is that it disconnects from the Wi-Fi very easily, just like it happens to me with an HP LaserJet M28w that I have, and the second drawback that I find is the ink cartridges, they last very little, so it is almost mandatory to register for HP+ which gives you three months of free ink, and the printer takes care of requesting it before it runs out and you receive it at your home.

HP DeskJet 4220e,No,Tassel Plus,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA MG3620,2024-01-17,Tecnófilo,3,1-2-3-star,All in one,"We are looking at a device that we can identify as an all-in-one, since we are not just looking at a printer, it can also scan and photocopy, in addition, it has a sheet feeder that offers a capacity of 35 sheets, perhaps not much, but it will be enough for the most common tasks. Currently we can find many models presented by different brands, but we know that HP has a recognized experience in this type of devices. One of the most important aspects to take into account before purchasing a printer, in addition to having the support of a recognized manufacturer, will also be the cost of its consumables. In this regard, laser printers are those that offer the best quantity-cost performance, but these devices are much more expensive, for this reason the option offered by this model is interesting, I am referring to the possibility of being able to obtain the ink cartridges directly at the desired address at very reasonable prices. This is a plan that we can choose depending on the use we make of the printer per month, for sporadic use, 10 sheets / month, the cost will be € 1.49 / month and if you need to print up to 50 sheets per month, the cost will be € 4.99 / month. Perhaps the most interesting plan for those who make intensive use of the printer, is the one that costs € 6.99 / month, since it allows you to print up to a total of 100 pages per month. One aspect that I did not like is the ink cartridge recognition system, that is, it will not work with those cartridges that are not original, personally, I think that this aspect should be the decision of the buyer who decides whether or not to use the original consumables. I must indicate that the output support for the sheets did not seem very robust to me, surely with use, it will end up getting damaged. Its initial configuration is simple, but we have to keep in mind that we will need a mobile phone to follow the steps, it will even be necessary to access the menu configuration, since, on the screen of the printer itself, we will only get information about the status of the device and the ink level of its cartridges. The aspect that I liked the least is knowing that it is not compatible with the automatic duplex mode, in this case, we will have to turn the sheet manually when we want to print on both sides. In general, an economical, simple printer that works very quickly without waiting. The main aspect to take into account, to determine if this model is the one you need, will be if you are interested in the prices of the plans that HP offers to receive the ink cartridges.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Con alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n-HP-impresi%C3%B3n-Fotocopia/product-reviews/B0CFG1PB4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Un todo en uno,

This device is not just a printer, it is a complete solution for our printing, scanning and copying needs. With a maximum print speed of up to 20 ppm in black and white and 16 ppm in color, it is a very efficient machine without sacrificing print quality. In addition, the possibility of printing double-sided manually and access via dual-band Wi-Fi and USB 2.0 add versatility. It also includes the Instant Ink function, which is a printing service with which you receive the cartridges at home when you need them and it also takes care of recycling them, paying a monthly fee, of course. This feature may be interesting for some people, but I prefer not to use it. I like to buy ink only when I need it, and with this monthly fee you will pay every month, whether you print or not. This HP DeskJet 4220e multifunction printer is a safe bet for use in our home. It is very versatile, the print quality is very good, and both the printer and the ink cartridges are very cheap.

HP DeskJet 2820e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-01-17,Xavi,4,4-5-star,Efficiency and Connectivity,"The HP DeskJet 2820e All-in-One Printer emerges as a stylish and practical solution for everyday printing needs, both in homes and small offices. Its 3-month Instant Ink printing with HP+ promotion adds considerable value, simplifying supplies management and offering convenience. One of the standout features of the HP DeskJet 2820e is its multifunctionality. Not only does it print with remarkable quality, but it also scans and copies effectively, making it a versatile tool for a variety of tasks. Its compact design is ideal for small spaces, keeping a work area tidy and clutter-free. The HP Instant Ink service is a big draw, especially for those who print regularly. This system monitors your ink levels and automatically sends new cartridges before you run out. The first 3 months free is a great way to try out the service and see how it can make your life easier, eliminating the need to remember to buy ink. The print quality of the DeskJet 2820e is impressive for a printer in its price range. Text documents are printed clearly and accurately, while photos and graphics come out with vivid colors and sharp details. This quality, combined with the ability to automatically print double-sided, makes it efficient and economical in terms of paper consumption. Connectivity is another strong point. With Wi-Fi connection options, you can easily print from various devices, including smartphones and tablets, adding convenience and flexibility to your workflow. However, there are aspects that could be improved. The print speed is not the fastest on the market, which could be a drawback for those who need to print large volumes of documents quickly. In addition, the HP Instant Ink service requires a subscription after the first 3 free months, which entails a recurring expense. Personally, I find the HP DeskJet 2820e to be a solid choice for home users and small offices looking for a reliable and affordable MFP. It offers excellent print quality, ease of use, and a convenient ink service, although it is important to consider print speed and long-term subscription costs.",,,,Diseño: NuevaNombre de estilo: Sin alimentador automático,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.es/HP-DeskJet-2820e-Impresora-Multifunci%C3%B3n/product-reviews/B0CFFWJHMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?formatType=current_format&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,Spain,Eficiencia y Conectividad,

This printer is nothing short of a disaster, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.Setting up this monstrosity is an exercise in futility. I spent countless hours trying to get it to work, following every instruction to the letter, but to no avail. Even with the help of an IT engineer, we couldn't get this thing to function properly. It's as if HP designed it to be deliberately incomprehensible.The user interface is about as intuitive as ancient hieroglyphics. Connectivity issues plague this printer like a curse, refusing to stay connected to Wi-Fi or computers for more than a few minutes at a time. When you finally think you've got it working, it decides to throw a tantrum and forget all your settings.Print quality? Let's just say a child with crayons could produce better results. Paper jams are more frequent than actual printing, and the ink seems to evaporate faster than water in the Sahara.Customer support is a joke. You'll spend hours on hold, only to be told to do the same useless troubleshooting steps you've already tried a hundred times.In conclusion, if you enjoy headaches, wasted time, and the feeling of utter despair, by all means, purchase the HP 2800 Series. For everyone else, I strongly advise looking elsewhere for your printing needs.

I had to take the whole lot out, just to put one the printed paper back in - and then you have to click continue on your laptop).

So many more print , scan copy options available on the easy to use large colour screen and from the app, and was simple to set up.

This printer it just gives you a few default sizes. There is an app you can use which gives you a few extra sizes like photo sizes but again these are default. There is a pain staking way of pasting a photo or document onto a page and then dragging the corners to change its size but it’s very long winded and fiddly. The other issue is getting the damn thing to actually print sometimes. You press print and nothing happens.

Setting it up was a relatively simple process and the Wi-Fi connection has been reliable so far. The print quality is pretty decent, especially for text documents and printing sewing patterns. I was also happy with the included 3 months of Instant Ink, which helped me avoid running out of ink right away (it's also super easy to set up your subscription and once the free months run out the subscription options aren't too expensive either).However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The printing speed isn't the fastest, so it's not ideal for high-volume printing jobs. This is especially true when printing pictures, even really basic ones and even when you're printing one image. My mother still has her old dot matrix printer from the mid 1980s and while it doesn't print in colour the black and white images it produces still print faster than this HP printer doing the same job!Also the paper tray is a bit on the small side, so you'll need to refill it more often if you print a lot. I think this holds 60 pages.Overall, I'd give the HP DeskJet 2810e 4 out of 5 stars. It's a good value for the (sale) price, and it's easy to use.

Trusting I was still in the HP technical support network I reluctantly gave the technician access and control of my Mac computer. We worked thru several attempts to link the printer wirelessly to my Mac without success. Technician then informed me there was problem with my internet connection. He offered me a $267 (FOUR times cost of printer) contract for an extended period of time for the ESL people to clean up of my internet connection. At that point I terminated the connection. I even unplugged my Mac and started over on the wireless connection process. For 5 HOURS I attempted to get the Desk Jet 2855e connected wirelessly. Several attempts did get the price for ESL folks to fix my internet connection down to $100. Finally gave up on wireless and connected cable and it worked OK but NOT wireless.

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-08-09,Michael,2,1-2-3-star,wireless printing capabilities are absolutely trash,"Print quality is fine, fast and with the usual downsides (expensive ink cartridges, about 15-20 cents per page). I do appreciate the support for single-black-cartridge mode, to avoid wasting color ink on ""fancy grayscale"" print settings (we don't need color printing anyway).Scan and copy functionality is fine.However, dealing with getting the printer to actually run a print job is infuriating. Over a Wi-Fi connection from my Windows 11 computer, trying to print something NEVER works the first time. I also have the HP Smart app installed but there is never any error message that shows up there. I have definitely updated all drivers, firmware, Windows updates, etc. It usually takes me about 20-30 minutes of troubleshooting with several of the below strategies (wasting time and extra test pages and ink) before I can finally get something to print:- printer does not wake from sleep mode, need to push power button to do so- restart printer by turning off and on- turn printer's wireless connection off and on using the Wi-Fi button- try printing a test page from Windows settings- try running the Windows troubleshooter- ""retry"" option in the Windows print queue- delete job from print queue and print the document again- remove printer from Windows list of devices and add it againAfter consistently dealing with this for over a year I finally decided to give up and purchase a USB-B cable to print using a wired connection. I have not tried this yet, hopefully it works, but I really wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't.I have had other HP printers in the past and they absolutely do not have so many problems with receiving jobs.

Ive had this printer for about 6 months. In terms of functionality, this printer has worked really well for me. Never had any issues with connectivity or even the hp printer software. The only issue (someone else used this term well), this printer is not yours after you buy it. It is essentially a rental. If you do not have a currently active instant ink subscription service going, hp software will not allow you to print anything. Now, the service is relatively inexpensive. About $6 or $7 a month and Ive never been in a spot where I am out of ink. But for those of us who only print a few pages a couple of days out if the month, this will not be the best printer to get. Ive had a payment not go through once due to me getting a new debit card and it took me a good 20 minutes to get it up and going again after changing my payment info. Doesn’t matter how many pages you printed, how much ink you have used. You’re giving them $6 and swapping out your hardly used ink carts for new ones or else you will not be allowed to use the printer. Pretty shady if you ask me and im not comfortable with the way they can remotely prevent you from using your printer that you already purchased.

The app works if you connected to your wifi first then loging in and connecting to the printer still don't fully connect. Then I've had the printer less than a month and barely printed 20 pages and I'm already out of ink then I go and connect it to get that instead ink 3 months free of cartridge and it kept telling me since I cannot connect the printer it won't sent it. So I tried connecting the printer on my phone will having the app loaded on my computer and it still won't connected I've just had alot of trouble with this printer and I'm going to exchange it for a diferent brand,,Verified Purchase,,Style: New Version,0,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/HP-DeskJet-Wireless-included-588S5A/product-reviews/B0CT2R7199/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_fmt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=recent,2024-09-21,US,,
