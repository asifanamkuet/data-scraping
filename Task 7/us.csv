There was fatal error. I never left the HP system but ended up with technical support from an English Secondary Language (ESL) technician. Trusting I was still in the HP technical support network I reluctantly gave the technician access and control of my Mac computer. We worked thru several attempts to link the printer wirelessly to my Mac without success. Technician then informed me there was problem with my internet connection. He offered me a $267 (FOUR times cost of printer) contract for an extended period of time for the ESL people to clean up of my internet connection. At that point I terminated the connection. I even unplugged my Mac and started over on the wireless connection process. For 5 HOURS I attempted to get the Desk Jet 2855e connected wirelessly. Several attempts did get the price for ESL folks to fix my internet connection down to $100. Finally gave up on wireless and connected cable and it worked OK but NOT wireless.

Over a Wi-Fi connection from my Windows 11 computer, trying to print something NEVER works the first time. I also have the HP Smart app installed but there is never any error message that shows up there. I have definitely updated all drivers, firmware, Windows updates, etc. It usually takes me about 20-30 minutes of troubleshooting with several of the below strategies (wasting time and extra test pages and ink) before I can finally get something to print:- printer does not wake from sleep mode, need to push power button to do so- restart printer by turning off and on- turn printer's wireless connection off and on using the Wi-Fi button- try printing a test page from Windows settings- try running the Windows troubleshooter- ""retry"" option in the Windows print queue- delete job from print queue and print the document again- remove printer from Windows list of devices and add it againAfter consistently dealing with this for over a year I finally decided to give up and purchase a USB-B cable to print using a wired connection.

HP DeskJet 2855e,No,Tassel Base,DeskJet,Amazon,Canon PIXMA TS3520,2024-09-03,Alec Bates,3,Be aware: Subscription Printer,"Ill make it short and sweet. Ive had this printer for about 6 months. In terms of functionality, this printer has worked really well for me. Never had any issues with connectivity or even the hp printer software. The only issue (someone else used this term well), this printer is not yours after you buy it. It is essentially a rental. If you do not have a currently active instant ink subscription service going, hp software will not allow you to print anything. Now, the service is relatively inexpensive. About $6 or $7 a month and Ive never been in a spot where I am out of ink. But for those of us who only print a few pages a couple of days out if the month, this will not be the best printer to get. Ive had a payment not go through once due to me getting a new debit card and it took me a good 20 minutes to get it up and going again after changing my payment info. Doesn’t matter how many pages you printed, how much ink you have used. You’re giving them $6 and swapping out your hardly used ink carts for new ones or else you will not be allowed to use the printer. Pretty shady if you ask me and im not comfortable with the way they can remotely prevent you from using your printer that you already purchased. Ill be continuing to use mine until i can eventually afford something that is better fit for less frequent printing/cart replacements but if you’re reading this.
